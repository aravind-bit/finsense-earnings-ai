  "ai_quarter_summary": "In Q2 2024, Adobe (ADBE) reported a 9% year-over-year increase in total revenue, driven primarily by strong subscription growth in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, with Digital Media ARR growing at double-digit rates. The gross margin improved by 80 basis points, attributed to pricing optimization and enhanced cloud efficiency. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance, now anticipating a slight improvement in operating margins compared to previous expectations. Key watchpoints include potential market saturation in digital media subscriptions and competitive pressures that could impact future growth rates.",
