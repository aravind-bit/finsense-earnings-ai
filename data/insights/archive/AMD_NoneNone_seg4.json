  "text_preview": "Thank you, Lisa. And good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results, and then provide\n\nour outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. We're pleased with our strong third quarter financial results. We\n\ndelivered record revenue of $9.2 billion, up 36% year over year, exceeding the high-end of our guidance,\n\nreflecting strong momentum across our business.\n\nOur third quarter results do not include any revenue from shipments of the MI308 GPU products to China.\n\nRevenue increased 20% sequentially, driven by strong growth in the data center and client and gaming segment\n\nand modest growth in the embedded segment.

On a sequential basis, data center revenue increased 34% primarily\n\ndriven by strong ramp of our AMD Instinct MI350 series GPUs.\n\n\fThe data center segment operating income was $1.1 billion, or 25% of revenue, compared to $1 billion a year\n\nago, or 29% of revenue, driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment, to capitalize on\n\nsignificant AI opportunities. Client and gaming segment revenue was a record of $4 billion, up 73% year over\n\nyear and 12% sequentially, driven by strong de"
