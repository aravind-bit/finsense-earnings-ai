These key principles are incorporated\n\nin WBD\u2019s Code of Ethics, Business Partner Statement of\n\nEthics, Production Ethics Code, and Modern Anti-Slavery\n\nPolicy, which are posted on our website. Our workplace\n\npolicies and practices include equal opportunity, non-\n\ndiscrimination, and prohibitions against forced labor and\n\nhuman trafficking.\n\nWe encourage our employees and external stakeholders to\n\nreport any suspicion or evidence of human rights abuses in\n\nour operations or in the operations of our suppliers to the\n\nreported immediately, without fear of reprisal.\n\nPeople and Culture team or to our Ethics Hotline.\n\nGiven the transitory nature of production work, major\n\nstudios across the industry collaborated to develop a\n\nstandardized training program for union production\n\nemployees. Celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2023,\n\nthis program is funded by the studios through their\n\ncollective bargaining agreements and overseen by the\n\nContract Services Administrative Trust Fund. In\n\nSouthern California, there are currently dozens of\n\ncourses for union production employees on topics such\n\nas fall protection, aerial work platforms, and\n\nenvironmental safety, among others, that employees\n\ntake based on the potential hazards related to their\n\nwork. Crew members on U.S. productions outside\n\nSouthern California have access to online and hands-on\n\nsafety training provided by an industry management-\n\nlabor Training Trust Fund.\n\nAt Warner Bros., a Production Safety Representative\n\n(PSR) oversees every television and film production, as\n\nassigned by the Vice President of Safety &\n\nEnvironmental Affairs. PSRs review scripts as\n\nnecessary, provide guidance on stunt and special\n\neffects activity, arrange additional safety training, and,\n\nwhen necessary, safety equipment. They also advise on\n\nremedia"
