  "text_preview": "All right. And for my follow-up, there is some industry debate at least about OpenAI's ability to simultaneously\n\nengage with all three merchant and the ASIC suppliers, just given the constraints around power and CapEx and\n\ntheir existing CSP partners and so forth. So how are you thinking about that? What is your level of visibility in the\n\ninitial engagement? And then more importantly, how it kind of broadens out into '27? Is there a way that one can\n\nmodel what the allocation would be, or just how should we think about the level of visibility in this very important\n\ncustomer? Thank you.\n\n\fLISA  SU:\n\nYeah, absolutely, Vivek. Look, we're very-- obviously very excited about our relationship with OpenAI. It's a very\n\nsignificant relationship. Think about it as-- it's a pretty unique time for AI right now. There's just so much compute\n\ndemand across all of the workloads. I think in our work with OpenAI, we are planning, multiple quarters out,\n\nensuring that the power is available, that the supply chain is available.\n\nThe key point is the first gigawatt we will start deploying in the second half of '26. And that work is well\n\nunderway. And we continue-- just given where lead times are and things like that, we are planning very closely\n\nwith OpenAI as well as the CSP partners to ensure that we're all prepared with Helios so that we can deploy the\n\ntechnology as we stated. So I think overall, we're working very closely together. I think we have good visibility\n\ninto the MI450 ramp. And things are progressing very well."
