  "text_preview": "Sure, Ross. Well, look, what I see is actually this environment where the world needs more AI compute. And from\n\nthat standpoint, I think OpenAI has kind of led in the quest for more AI compute. But they're not alone. I think\n\nwhen you look across the large customers, there is really a demand for more AI compute as you go forward over\n\nthe next couple of years. I think we each have our advantages in terms of how we are positioning our products. I\n\nthink MI450 series, in particular, I think is an extremely strong product, Rack Scale Solution.\n\nOverall, when we look at compute performance, when we look at memory performance, we think it's extremely\n\nwell-positioned for both inference as well as training. I think the key here is time to market, its total cost of\n\nownership, its deep partnership. And thinking about not just MI450 series, but what happens after that. So we're\n\ndeep in conversations on MI500 and beyond.\n\nAnd we certainly think we're well-positioned to not only participate but participate in a very meaningful way\n\nacross the demand environment here. And I think we have certainly learned a ton over the last couple of years\n\nwith our AI roadmap. We've made significant inroads in terms of just what the largest customer needs from a\n\nworkload standpoint. So I'm pretty optimistic about our ability to capture a significant piece of this market going\n\nforward.\n\n\fROSS\n\nAnd I guess as my follow-up, it'll be a direct follow on to that. You did a unique structure by granting some"
