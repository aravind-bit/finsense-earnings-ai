  "text_preview": "Sure, Josh. So a couple of comments on the CPU server side. I think we've been watching this trend for the last\n\ncouple of quarters. And we started seeing, let's call it, some positive signs in CPU demand actually a couple of\n\nquarters ago. And what's happened as we've gone through 2025 is now we see a broadening of that CPU\n\ndemand. So we have-- a number of our large hyperscale clients are now forecasting significant CPU build into\n\n2026.\n\nAnd so from that standpoint, I think it's a positive demand environment. And it is because AI is requiring quite a\n\nbit of general purpose compute. And that's great. It catches our cycle as we're ramping turn. So the turn ramp\n\nhas gone extremely fast. And we see good pull for that product as well as consistent strong demand for our\n\ngeneral product line as well.\n\nSo back to seasonality as we go into 2026. I think we expect that the CPU demand environment into 2026 is\n\ngoing to be, let's call it positive. And so we'll guide more as we get into the end of the year, but I would expect a\n\npositive demand environment for CPUs as we see this demand. I do feel like it's durable. It is not a short-term\n\nthing. I think it is a multi-quarter phenomenon, as we're seeing just much more demand as these AI workloads\n\nreally turn into-- you have to do real work."
