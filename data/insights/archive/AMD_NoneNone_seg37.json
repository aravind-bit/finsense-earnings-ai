  "text_preview": "But, Lisa, you've been very consistent. $500 billion of total AI silicon TAM opportunity, and obviously, progressing\n\nabove that. I'm curious as we think about these large megawatt kind of deployments, how you think about the\n\nupdated views on that AI silicon TAM as we look forward.\n\n\fLISA  SU:\n\nWell, Aaron, as you said, not to take too much away from what we're going to talk about next week. Look, we're\n\ngoing to give you a full picture of how we see the market next week. But suffice it to say, from everything that we\n\nsee, we see the AI compute TAM just going up. So we'll have some updated numbers for you. But the view is,\n\nwhereas $500 billion sounded like a lot when we first talked about it, we think there is a larger opportunity for us\n\nover the next few years. And that's pretty exciting."
