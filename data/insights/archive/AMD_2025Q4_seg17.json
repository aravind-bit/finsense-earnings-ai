  "text_preview": "Yeah, Josh. Thanks for the question. Look, we've made great progress with ROCm. ROCm 7 is a significant step\n\nforward in terms of performance and all the frameworks that we support. It's been a really, really important for\n\nus to get day 0 support of all the newest models and native support for all the newest frameworks. I would say\n\nmost customers who are starting with AMD now have a very smooth experience as they're bringing on their\n\nworkloads to AMD.\n\nThere's obviously always more work to do. We're continuing to augment the libraries and the overall environment\n\nthat we have, especially as we go to some of the newer workloads, where you see training and inference really\n\ncoming together with reinforcement learning. But overall, I think very strong progress with ROCm. And by the\n\nway, we're going to continue to invest in this area, because it's so important to really make our customer\n\ndevelopment experience as smooth as we can."
