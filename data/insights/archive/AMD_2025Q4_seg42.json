  "text_preview": "I think we have seen some early indications of that, Antoine. I think the key point being-- clearly, there's a desire\n\nto get on the latest and greatest GPUs when you're building new data center infrastructure. And certainly, when\n\nwe're looking at MI355, they're often going into new liquid cooled facilities, MI450 series as well.\n\nBut then we're also seeing the other trend, which is there's just a need for more AI compute. And from that\n\nstandpoint, some of the older generations-- MI300X is still doing quite well in terms of just where we see people\n\ndeploying and using us, especially for inference. And from that standpoint, I think you see a little bit of both."
