  "text_preview": "Yes, CJ. Thanks for the question. I think, in general, as we said in the past, for our data center GPU business, the\n\ngross margin continued to improve when we ramped a new generation of products. Typically at the beginning of\n\nthe ramp, you go through a transition period, then you will normalize the gross margin. We're not guiding 2026,\n\nbut our priority in data center GPU business is to really expand the top line revenue growth and the gross margin\n\ndollars. And of course, at the same time, it will continue to drive gross margin percentage up too."
