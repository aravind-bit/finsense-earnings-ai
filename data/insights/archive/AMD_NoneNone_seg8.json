  "text_preview": "Sure, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So a couple of comments. We had a very strong Q3 for the data center\n\nbusiness. I think we saw a strong outperformance in both the server as well as the data center AI business. And\n\nreminder that that was without any MI308 sales. The MI355 has ramped really nicely. We expected a sharp ramp\n\ninto the third quarter, and that proceeded well.\n\nAnd as I mentioned, we've also seen some strengthening of the server CPU sales and not just-- let's call it near-\n\nterm, but we're seeing our customers are giving us some visibility in the next few quarters that they see\n\nelevated demand, which is positive. Going into the fourth quarter, again, strong data center performance, up\n\ndouble digits sequentially and up in both server and data center AI, again, on the strength of those businesses.\n\nAnd to your question, I mean, we're not guiding into 2026 yet, obviously, but given what we see today, we see a\n\nvery good demand environment into 2026. So we would expect that MI355 continue to ramp in the first half '26\n\n26. And then as we mentioned, MI450 series comes online in the second half of 2026, and we would expect a\n\nsharper ramp as we go into the second half of 2026 of our data center AI business."
