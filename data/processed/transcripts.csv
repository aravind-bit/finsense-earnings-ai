Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Adobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not
be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its
ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors
should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with
GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to
evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency
with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the
analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate Adobe’s operating results and future prospects in the same manner as
management.

Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP
measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, investment gains
and losses, income tax adjustments and other items that are not considered part of Adobe’s ongoing operations, and the income tax effect of
the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the
performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used,
Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are
encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Adobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not
be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its
ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors
should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with
GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to
evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency
with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the
analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate Adobe’s operating results and future prospects in the same manner as
management.

Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP
measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, investment gains
and losses, income tax adjustments and other items that are not considered part of Adobe’s ongoing operations, and the income tax effect of
the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the
performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used,
Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are
encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.

Content accounting standards.

We use two accounting standards for our content costs. Since we launched streaming in 2007, we
have used the guidance of ASC 920: Entertainment - Broadcasters because we started the
streaming service with content that we license (rather than own).

● We license both Netﬂix originals (such as Wednesday and Emily in Paris) as well as 2nd run

titles, such as Shameless and The Blacklist

In 2016, we also began applying the guidance of ASC 926: Entertainment - Films for the original
content that we produce and where we own the intellectual property.

● We believe the beneﬁts of self-producing content include lower costs (no studio

middle-man), ownership of the intellectual property, which allows us to potentially monetize
in diﬀerent ways (e.g., licensing & merchandising) and greater rights ﬂexibility (global rights,
exclusivity)

In 2019, we adopted the update (ASU 2019-2) to accounting standards ASC 920 and 926. There
was no material impact as our accounting policies were already consistent with the new rules.

Amortization methodology.

●

The amortization schedule for content is based on historical and estimated viewing patterns
and is reviewed quarterly.

● All titles in our content library are amortized on an accelerated basis.

● Content assets are amortized over the shorter of the title’s window of availability, estimated

useful life, or 10 years.

● On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced streaming content asset is expected to be

amortized within four years after its launch.

●

First run topical programming, like sports, talk shows and other live events, is expensed upon
airing.

Criteria for ASC 920.

ASC 920 speciﬁes that a broadcaster shall account for a license agreement for program material
as a purchase of rights

Under ASC 920, the following 3 criteria must be met in order for the content we license to qualify
for asset recognition:

●
●
●

The cost of each title is known or reasonably determinable
The title (source ﬁle) has been received
The title is available for ﬁrst showing

9

We use ASC 926 for produced assets.

For content that we produce, we capitalize the costs associated with production, including
development cost, direct costs and production overhead. These amounts and licensed content
are included in “Content assets, net” and classiﬁed as non-current assets on our balance sheet in
accordance with ASU 2019-2.

Amortization expense disclosure.

(1) Tax incentives earned on qualified production spend generally reduce the cost-basis of content assets and result in lower content amortization over the life of the title. For the years
ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, tax incentives resulted in lower content amortization on produced content of approximately $899 million, $835 million and $719 million,
respectively.

16

Content Obligations.

Content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of
content. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under
creative talent and employment agreements, as well as other production related commitments. An
obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an
agreement to obtain future titles.

●

These obligations reﬂect content costs that will be amortized to the income statement in the
future once the 3 criteria for ASC 920 are met.

● Disney and Fox have similar obligations related to their programming commitments.

Those that are not reﬂected on the balance sheet do not yet meet asset recognition criteria (see
slide 9) and:

Either will never meet asset recognition criteria because cost per title is unknown, or

●
● Cost per title is known but titles are not yet available for showing.

17

Content Obligations (cont’d).

18

Content Obligations.

●

●

Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate
quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date and are not
included in content obligations. Traditional ﬁlm output deals or certain TV series license
agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of
agreements.

These unknown obligations are expected to be signiﬁcant and we believe could include
approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast
majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. Once we know the title
that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table.

19

Impact on
Cash Flow.

20

Cash costs for original content are
more front end loaded.

● For produced original content, we often fund the production costs during the

content creation process prior to completion and release on the Netﬂix service.
This could be years in advance of a release date.

● This also creates a content asset with a useful life well into the future.
● For licensed originals, cash payment terms also generally exceed expense in the

early years.

● Payment for second window and catalog licensed content is generally upon

delivery and over the window of availability.

21

Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ).

22

FAQ.

You have discussed your ratio of cash spending on content to P&L spending on
content. What does this refer to?

●

●

This ratio is our cash spending on content (as derived from our cash ﬂow
statement) divided by our content amortization (which ﬂows through our income
statement)
This ratio is an indicator of the timing diﬀerences between cash payment terms
on content vs. the content expense recognition

● Cash payments are more front-loaded, especially for produced content which we
must fund during the production process before the content is completed and
available for viewing

23

FAQ (continued).

How do I calculate your cash spending on content?

● Cash spending on content can be derived from our cash ﬂow statement. The
sum of Additions to Content Assets and the Change in Content Liabilities
equates to our cash spending on content

~$17.0 bil. in cash spent
on content in FY24 vs.
$15.3 bil. in content
amortization, resulting in
a 1.1x ratio of cash spend
on content to content
amort. ratio

24

FAQ (continued).

Can I divide your content amortization by your content library to derive an
indication of your average amortization term or changes in your amortization
schedules?

● No, because our content library is presented net of amortization, not on a

gross basis

● On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced streaming content asset is

expected to be amortized within four years after its launch.

● Our amortization in any given period is also aﬀected by the mix of content as

diﬀerent categories of content are amortized on diﬀerent schedules (based
on historical and estimated viewing patterns)

25

FAQ (continued).

What is your process for determining possible impairment of your content library?

● Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group

and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in
circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or
that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost.

● We also review at a title level if a speciﬁc title is pulled down permanently or

expected to be abandoned.

● Content assets are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value if an

impairment is identiﬁed.

26

FAQ (continued).

Are there other non-amortization content costs in cost of revenue on your income
statement?

●

●

●

Yes, our cost of revenues also include other content costs that are not classiﬁed
as amortization.
These costs include content personnel costs, portions of our overall deals with
certain content creators, music rights and miscellaneous expenses related to
production.
In addition, other cost of revenue include streaming delivery expenses and other
operating costs like payment processing and customer service and other costs
involved in making our content available to members

record revenue and profitability reflecting broad-based demand across our data center AI, server and PC

businesses.

Revenue grew 36% year over year to $9.2 billion, net income rose 31%, and free cash flow more than tripled, led

by record EPYC, Ryzen and Instinct processor sales. Our record third quarter performance marks a clear step up

in our growth trajectory, as the combination of our expanding compute franchise and rapidly scaling data center

AI business drives significant revenue and earnings growth.

Turning to our segments. Data center segment revenue increased 22% year over year to a record $4.3 billion,

led by the ramp of our Instinct MI350 series GPUs and server share gains. Server CPU revenue reached an all-

time high, as adoption of fifth Gen EPYC turn processors accelerated rapidly, accounting for nearly half of overall

EPYC revenue in the quarter. Sales of our prior generation EPYC processors were also very robust in the quarter,

reflecting their strong competitive positioning across a wide range of workloads.

In cloud, we had record sales as hyperscalers expanded EPYC CPU deployments to power both their own first

party services and public cloud offerings. Hyperscalers launched more than 160 EPYC powered instances in the

quarter, including new turn offerings from Google, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba and others that deliver unmatched

performance and price performance across a wide range of workloads. There are now more than 1,350 public

EPYC cloud instances available globally, a nearly 50% increase from a year ago.

Adoption of EPYC in cloud by large businesses more than tripled year over year, as our on-prem share gains are

driving increased demand from enterprise customers for AMD cloud instances to support hybrid compute. We

expect cloud demand to remain very strong as hyperscalers are significantly increasing their general purpose

compute capacity as they scale their AI workloads. Many customers are now planning substantially larger CPU

build outs over the coming quarters to support increased demands from AI, serving as a powerful new catalyst

for our server business.

Turning to enterprise adoption, EPYC server sell through increased sharply year over year and sequentially,

reflecting accelerating enterprise adoption. More than 175th Gen EPYC platforms are in market from HPE, Dell,

Lenovo, Supermicro, and others. Our broadest portfolio to date, with solutions optimized for virtually every

enterprise workload.

We closed large new wins in the quarter with leading fortune 500 technology, telecom, financial services, retail,

streaming, social and automotive companies as we expand our footprint across major verticals. The performance

in TCO advantages of our EPYC portfolio, combined with our increased go to market investments and the

expanded breadth of offerings from the leading server and solutions providers, positioned us well for continued

enterprise share gains.

Looking ahead, we remain on track to launch our next generation 2 nanometer Venice processors in 2026.

Venice Silicon is in the labs and performing very well, delivering substantial gains in performance, efficiency and

compute density. Customer pull and engagement for Venice are the strongest we have seen, reflecting our

competitive positioning and the growing demand for more data center compute. Multiple cloud OEM partners

have already brought their first Venice platforms online, setting the stage for broad solution availability and cloud

deployments at launch.

Turning to data center AI. Our instinct GPU business continues to accelerate. Revenue grew year over year,

driven by the sharp ramp of MI350 series GPU sales and broader MI300 series deployments. Multiple MI350 series

deployments are underway, with large cloud and AI providers, with additional large scale rollouts on track to

ramp over the coming quarters.

Oracle became the first hyperscaler to publicly offer MI355x instances, delivering significantly higher

performance for real-time inference and multimodal training workloads on OCI Zettascale SuperCluster. Neocloud

providers Crusoe, DigitalOcean, TensorWave, Vultr and others also began ramping availability of their MI350

series public cloud offerings in the quarter.

MI300 series GPU deployments with AI developers also broadened in the quarter. IBM and Zyphra will train

multiple generations of future multimodal models on a large scale MI300X cluster. And Cohere is now using

MI300X at OCI to train its command family of models. For inference, a number of new partners, including

character AI and Luma AI, are now running production workloads on MI300 series, demonstrating the

performance and TCO advantages of our architecture for real-time AI applications.

We also made significant progress on the software front in the quarter. We launched ROCm 7, our most

advanced and feature-rich release to date, delivering up to 4.6x higher inference and 3x higher training

performance compared to ROCm 6. ROCm 7 also introduces seamless distributed inference, enhanced code

portability across hardware, and new enterprise tools that simplify the deployment and management of instinct

solutions. Importantly, our open software strategy is resonating with developers Hugging Face VLM, SG Lang, and

others contributed directly to ROCm 7 as we make ROCm the open platform for AI development at scale.

Looking ahead, our data center AI business is entering its next phase of growth, with customer momentum

building rapidly ahead of the launch of our next Gen MI400 series accelerators and Helios Rack scale solutions in

2026. The MI400 series combines a new Compute Engine with industry leading memory capacity and advanced

networking capabilities to deliver a major leap in performance for the most demanding AI training and inference

workloads.

The MI400 series brings together our silicon software and systems expertise to power Helios. Our rack scale AI

platform designed to redefine performance and efficiency at data center scale. Helios integrates our instinct

MI400 series GPUs, Venice EPYC CPUs, and Pensando NICs in a double-wide rack solution optimized for the

performance, power, cooling, and serviceability required for the next generation of AI infrastructure, and

supports Meta's new open rack wide standard.

Development of both our MI400 series GPUs and Helios rack is progressing rapidly. Supported by deep technical

engagements across a growing set of hyperscalers, AI companies, and OEM and ODM partners to enable large

scale deployments next year. The ZT systems team, we acquired last year is playing a critical role in Helios

development, leveraging their decades of experience building infrastructure for the world's largest cloud

providers to ensure customers can deploy and scale Helios quickly within their environments.

In addition, last week, we completed the sale of the ZT manufacturing business to Sanmina and entered a

strategic partnership that makes them our lead manufacturing partner for Helios. This collaboration will

accelerate large customer deployments of our rack scale AI solutions.

On the customer front, we announced a comprehensive multiyear agreement with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts

of Instinct GPUs with the first gigawatt of MI450 series accelerators scheduled to start coming online in the

second half of 2026. The partnership establishes AMD as a core compute provider for OpenAI and underscores

the strength of our hardware, software, and full stack solutions strategy.

Moving forward, AMD and OpenAI will work even more closely on future hardware, software, networking, and

system level roadmaps and technologies. OpenAI's decision to use AMD Instinct platforms for its most

sophisticated and complex AI workloads sends a clear signal that our Instinct GPUs and ROCm open software

stack deliver the performance and TCO required for the most demanding deployments. We expect this

partnership will significantly accelerate our data center AI business, with the potential to generate well over $100

billion in revenue over the next few years.

Oracle announced they will also be a lead launch partner for the MI450 series, deploying tens of thousands of

MI450 GPUs across Oracle Cloud Infrastructure beginning in 2026 and expanding through 2027 and beyond. Our

Instinct platforms are also gaining traction with sovereign AI and national supercomputing programs.

In the UAE, Cisco and G42 will deploy a large scale AI cluster powered by Instinct MI350X GPUs to support the

nation's most advanced AI workloads. In the US, we are partnering with the Department of Energy and Oak Ridge

National Labs to build LuxAI, the first AI factory dedicated to scientific discovery, together with our industrial

partners OCI and HPE. Powered by our Instinct MI350 series GPUs, EPYC CPUs, and Pensando networking, LuxAI

will provide a secure, open platform for large scale training and distributed inference when it comes online in

early 2026.

The US Department of Energy also selected our upcoming MI430X GPUs and EPYC Zen CPUs to power discovery,

the next flagship supercomputer at Oak Ridge designed to set the standard for AI-driven scientific computing and

extend US high performance computing leadership. Our MI430X GPUs are designed specifically to power nation

scale AI and supercomputing programs, extending our leadership, powering the world's most powerful computers

to enable the next generation of scientific breakthroughs.

In summary, our AI business is entering a new phase of growth and is on a clear trajectory towards tens of

billions in annual revenue in 2027, driven by our leadership rack scale solutions, expanding customer adoption,

and an increasing number of large scale global deployments. I look forward to providing more details on our data

center AI growth plans at our financial analyst day next week.

In client and gaming, segment revenue increased 73% year over year to four billion. Our PC processor business

is performing exceptionally well, with record quarterly sales as the strong demand environment and breadth of

our leadership Ryzen portfolio accelerates growth. Desktop CPU sales reached an all-time high, with record

channel selling and sellout led by robust demand for Ryzen 9,000 processors, which deliver unmatched

performance across gaming productivity and content creation applications.

OEM sell through of Ryzen powered notebooks also increased sharply in the quarter, reflecting sustained end

customer pull for premium gaming and commercial AMD PCs. Commercial momentum accelerated in the quarter,

with rising PC sell through up more than 30% year over year as enterprise adoption grew sharply, driven by large

wins with Fortune 500 companies across healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, automotive and

pharmaceuticals.

Looking ahead, we see significant opportunity to continue growing our client business faster than the overall PC

market based on the strength of our Ryzen portfolio, broader platform coverage and expanded go to market

investments. In gaming, revenue increased 181% year over year to $1.3 billion. Semicustom revenue increased

as Sony and Microsoft prepare for the upcoming holiday sales period.

In gaming graphics, revenue and channel sellout grew significantly, driven by the performance per dollar

leadership of our Radeon 9000 family. FSR4, our machine learning upscaling technology that boosts frame rates

and creates more immersive visuals, saw rapid adoption this quarter, with the number of supported games

doubling since launch to more than 85.

Turning to our embedded segment. Revenue decreased 8% year over year to $857 million. Sequentially, revenue

and sell through increased as the demand environment strengthened across multiple markets, led by test and

emulation. Aerospace and defense, and industrial vision and healthcare.

We expanded our embedded product portfolio with new solutions that extend our leadership across adaptive and

x86 computing. We began shipping industry leading Versal prime series Gen 2 adaptive SoCs to lead customers,

delivered our first virtual RF development platforms to support several next generation design wins, and

introduced the Ryzen embedded 9000 series with industry leading performance per watt and latency for robotics,

edge computing, and smart factory applications.

The design momentum remains very strong across our embedded portfolio. We are on track for a second straight

year of record design wins already totaling more than $14 billion year to date, reflecting the growing adoption of

our leadership products across a broad range of markets and expanding set of applications.

In summary, our record third quarter results and strong fourth quarter outlook reflect the significant momentum

building across our business, driven by sustained product leadership and disciplined execution. Our data center

AI, server, and PC businesses are each entering periods of strong growth, led by an expanding TAM, accelerating

adoption of our instinct platforms and EPYC and Ryzen CPU share gains.

The demand for compute has never been greater, as every major breakthrough in business, science and society

now relies on access to more powerful, efficient, and intelligent computing. These trends are driving

unprecedented growth opportunities for AMD. I look forward to sharing more on our strategy, roadmaps, and

long range financial targets at our financial analyst meeting next week. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jean to

provide additional color on our third quarter results. Jean?",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_2025Q4_Transcript.pdf,AMD 2025Q4 Transcript,2025.0,Q4,2025-11-24,4,JEAN  HU,prepared_remarks,"Thank you, Lisa. And good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results, and then provide

our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. We're pleased with our strong third quarter financial results. We

delivered record revenue of $9.2 billion, up 36% year over year, exceeding the high-end of our guidance,

reflecting strong momentum across our business.

Our third quarter results do not include any revenue from shipments of the MI308 GPU products to China.

Revenue increased 20% sequentially, driven by strong growth in the data center and client and gaming segment

and modest growth in the embedded segment. Gross margin was 54% up 40 basis points year over year,

primarily driven by product mix.

Operating expenses were approximately $2.8 billion, an increase of 42% year over year as we continue to invest

aggressively in R&D to capitalize on significant AI opportunities and go to market activities for revenue growth.

Operating income was $2.2 billion, representing a 24% operating margin, taxes, interest expense, and other

totaled $273 million. For the third quarter of 2025, diluted earnings per share were $1.20 compared to $0.92 a

year ago, an increase of 30% year over year.

Now, turning to our reportable segments, starting with the data center. Data center segment revenue was a

record of $4.3 billion, up 22% year over year, primarily driven by the strong demand for fifth generation EPYC

processors and Instinct MI350 series GPUs. On a sequential basis, data center revenue increased 34% primarily

driven by strong ramp of our AMD Instinct MI350 series GPUs.

The data center segment operating income was $1.1 billion, or 25% of revenue, compared to $1 billion a year

ago, or 29% of revenue, driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment, to capitalize on

significant AI opportunities. Client and gaming segment revenue was a record of $4 billion, up 73% year over

year and 12% sequentially, driven by strong demand for the latest generation of client and graphics processors

and stronger sales of console gaming products.

In a client business, revenue was a record $2.8 billion, up 46% year over year and 10% sequentially, driven by

record sales of our Ryzen processors and the richer product mix. Gaming revenue rose to $1.3 billion, up 181%

year over year and 16% sequentially, reflecting higher semi-customer revenue and strong demand for our

Radeon GPUs. Client gaming segment operating income was $867 million, or 21% of revenue, compared to $288

million, or 12% a year ago, driven by higher revenue, partially offset by increase in go to market investment to

support our revenue growth.

Embedded segment revenue was $857 million, down 8% year over year. Embedded was up 4% sequentially as

we saw certain end market demand strengthen. Embedded segment operating income was $283 million, or 33%

of revenue, compared to $372 million, or 40% a year ago. The decline in operating income was primarily due to

lower revenue and end market mix.

Before I review the balance sheet and the cash flow, as a reminder, we closed the sale of ZT system and

manufacturing business to Sanmina last week. The third quarter financial results of the ZT manufacturing

business are reported separately in our financial statements as discontinued operations and are excluded from

our non-GAAP financials.

Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $1.8 billion in cash from operating

activities of continuing operations, and free cash flow was a record of $1.5 billion. We returned $89 million to

shareholders through share repurchases, resulting in $1.3 billion in share repurchases for the first three quarters

of 2025. Exiting the quarter, we have $1.4 billion authorization remaining under our share repurchase program.

At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment was $7.2 billion. Our total debt was

$3.2 billion.

Now turning to our fourth quarter 2025 outlook. Please note that our fourth quarter outlook does not include any

revenue from AMD Instinct MI308 shipment to China. For the fourth quarter of 2025, we expect revenue to be

approximately $9.6 billion plus or negative $300 million. The midpoint of our guidance represents approximately

25% year over year revenue growth, driven by strong double digit growth in our data center and client and

gaming segment, and the return to growth in our embedded segment.

Sequentially, we expect revenue to grow by approximately 4% driven by double digit growth in the data center

segment with strong growth in server and the continued ramp of our MI350 series GPUs. A decline in our client

gaming segment with client revenue increasing and gaming revenue down strong double digits, and the double

digit growth in our embedded segment.

In addition, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54.5%. And we expect non-

GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.8 billion. We expect net interest and other expenses to be a

gain of approximately $37 million. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%. And diluted share count

is expected to be approximately $1.65 billion shares.

In closing, we executed very well, delivering record revenue for the first three quarters of the year. The strategic

investments we are making positioned us well to capitalize on the expanding AI opportunities across all our end

markets, driving sustainable long-term revenue growth and earnings expansion for compelling shareholder value

creation. With that, I'll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session.",manual_drop

hoping if you could give us some sense of the CPU GPU mix in Q3 and Q4. And just tactically, how are you

managing this transition from your MI355 towards MI400 in second half of next year? Can you continue to grow in

the first half of next year from these Q4 levels, or should we expect some pause or digestion before customers

get on board the MI400 series?",manual_drop

business. I think we saw a strong outperformance in both the server as well as the data center AI business. And

reminder that that was without any MI308 sales. The MI355 has ramped really nicely. We expected a sharp ramp

into the third quarter, and that proceeded well.

And as I mentioned, we've also seen some strengthening of the server CPU sales and not just-- let's call it near-

term, but we're seeing our customers are giving us some visibility in the next few quarters that they see

elevated demand, which is positive. Going into the fourth quarter, again, strong data center performance, up

double digits sequentially and up in both server and data center AI, again, on the strength of those businesses.

And to your question, I mean, we're not guiding into 2026 yet, obviously, but given what we see today, we see a

very good demand environment into 2026. So we would expect that MI355 continue to ramp in the first half '26

26. And then as we mentioned, MI450 series comes online in the second half of 2026, and we would expect a

sharper ramp as we go into the second half of 2026 of our data center AI business.",manual_drop

engage with all three merchant and the ASIC suppliers, just given the constraints around power and CapEx and

their existing CSP partners and so forth. So how are you thinking about that? What is your level of visibility in the

initial engagement? And then more importantly, how it kind of broadens out into '27? Is there a way that one can

model what the allocation would be, or just how should we think about the level of visibility in this very important

customer? Thank you.

LISA  SU:

Yeah, absolutely, Vivek. Look, we're very-- obviously very excited about our relationship with OpenAI. It's a very

significant relationship. Think about it as-- it's a pretty unique time for AI right now. There's just so much compute

demand across all of the workloads. I think in our work with OpenAI, we are planning, multiple quarters out,

ensuring that the power is available, that the supply chain is available.

The key point is the first gigawatt we will start deploying in the second half of '26. And that work is well

underway. And we continue-- just given where lead times are and things like that, we are planning very closely

with OpenAI as well as the CSP partners to ensure that we're all prepared with Helios so that we can deploy the

technology as we stated. So I think overall, we're working very closely together. I think we have good visibility

into the MI450 ramp. And things are progressing very well.",manual_drop

THOMAS

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good results. I had a first question on Helios,

O'MALLEY:

obviously with the announcement at OCP. Customer interaction has to be growing. Could you talk about into next

year, what your view is on discrete sales versus system sales? When do you see that crossover kind of

happening? And just what initial responses have been from customers after getting a better look at it at the

show?",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_2025Q4_Transcript.pdf,AMD 2025Q4 Transcript,2025.0,Q4,2025-11-24,11,LISA  SU,prepared_remarks,"Yeah, sure. Tom, thanks for the question. There's a lot of excitement around MI450 in Helios. I think the OCP

reception was phenomenal. We had numerous customers and frankly, bringing their engineering teams to

understand more about the system, more about how it's built.

There's always been some discussion about just how complex these Rack Scale systems are, and they certainly

are. And we are very proud of the Helios design. I think it has all of the features, functions, reliability,

performance, power performance, that you would expect. I think the interest in MI450 and Helios has just

expanded over the last number of weeks, certainly with some of the announcements that we've made with

OpenAI and OCI, as well as the OCP show with Meta.

I think, overall, from our perspective, I think things are going, really well in both the development as well as the

customer engagement there. So in terms of Rack Scale Solutions, we would expect that the early customers for

MI450 will really be around the rack scale solutions. We will have other form factors as well for the MI450 series,

but there's a lot of interest in the full Rack Scale Solution.

THOMAS

Super helpful. And then as my follow up, it's a broader question as well and similar to what Vivek asked. But if

O'MALLEY:

you look at the power requirements that are out there for some of the early announcements into next year,

they're pretty substantial. And then you also have component issues that you're seeing across interconnected

memory.

Just from your perspective as an industry leader, where do you think that the constraint will be? Will it come first

with components not being available, or do you think that both data center footprint in terms of infrastructure

and/or power, is the gating factor to some of these deployments into next year, just as we really see some larger

numbers start to get deployed? Thank you.

LISA  SU:

Yeah, sure, Tom. I think what you're pointing out is what we, as an industry, have to do together. The entire

ecosystem has to plan together. And that is exactly what we're doing. So we're working with our customers on

their power plans over the next, actually, I would say two years from a silicon and a memory and a packaging

and a component supply chain. We're working with our supply chain partners to make sure all of that capacity is

available.

I can tell you from our visibility, we feel very good that we have a strong supply chain that is prepared to deliver

these very significant growth rates and large amounts of compute that is out there. And I think all of this is going

to be tight. I think there is a-- you can see from some of the CapEx spending that there's a desire to put on more

compute, and we're working closely together.

I will say that the ecosystem is very, I would say, works very hard when there are these types of let's call it

tightness out there. And so we also see things open up as we're working-- getting more power, getting more

supply, all of those things. So the net-net is, I think, we are well-positioned to grow significantly as we transition

into the second half of '26 into '27 with the MI450 and Helios.",manual_drop

couple of quarters. And we started seeing, let's call it, some positive signs in CPU demand actually a couple of

quarters ago. And what's happened as we've gone through 2025 is now we see a broadening of that CPU

demand. So we have-- a number of our large hyperscale clients are now forecasting significant CPU build into

2026.

And so from that standpoint, I think it's a positive demand environment. And it is because AI is requiring quite a

bit of general purpose compute. And that's great. It catches our cycle as we're ramping turn. So the turn ramp

has gone extremely fast. And we see good pull for that product as well as consistent strong demand for our

general product line as well.

So back to seasonality as we go into 2026. I think we expect that the CPU demand environment into 2026 is

going to be, let's call it positive. And so we'll guide more as we get into the end of the year, but I would expect a

positive demand environment for CPUs as we see this demand. I do feel like it's durable. It is not a short-term

thing. I think it is a multi-quarter phenomenon, as we're seeing just much more demand as these AI workloads

engaged with customers that you wouldn't have been engaged with if you hadn't done this deal?

That's the first part of the question. And then the second part relates to a prior question, which is that it looks like

they could be something like half of your data center GPU revenue in the 2027, 2028 frame. So how much risk in

your mind is there around that single customer for you?

LISA  SU:

Sure, Tim. So let me say a couple of things. First of all, the OpenAI deal has been in the works for quite some

time. We're happy to be able to talk about it broadly, and also talk about the scale of the deployment and the

scale of the engagement being multi-year, multi gigawatt. I think all those things were very positive.

We've had a number of other engagements as well. I think over the last-- if you were asked to ask specifically

over the last month, I would say that it's been a number of factors. I think the OpenAI deal was one of them. I

think having-- being able to show the Helios rack in full force at open compute was also a very important

milestone, because people could see the engineering and the capabilities of the Helios rack. And if you're asking

whether we've seen a increase of interest or an acceleration of interest, I think the answer is yes.

I think customers are broadly engaged and perhaps broadly engaged at a higher scale, which is a good thing.

And then from the standpoint of customer concentration, I think a very key foundation for us in this business is to

have a broad set of customers. We've always been engaged with a number of customers. I think we're

dimensioning the supply chain in such a way that we would have ample supply to have multiple customers at

similar scale as we go into the '27-'28 time frame. And that's certainly the goal.",manual_drop

how do you guys just think about that going forward?",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_2025Q4_Transcript.pdf,AMD 2025Q4 Transcript,2025.0,Q4,2025-11-24,36,LISA  SU,prepared_remarks,"Yeah. So Aaron, on the server CPU side, Turin certainly is more content. So we see ASPs grow as Turin ramps. But

I also mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're actually seeing a good mix of Genoa still there. So Turin is

ramping up very quickly, but we are also seeing Genoa demand continue well as-- the hyperscalers are not able

to move everything to the latest generation immediately.

So from our standpoint, I think it's broad-based CPU demand across a number of different workloads. This is-- a

little bit of this is, let's call it, server refresh. But it seems like, from our customer conversations, the workloads

are broadly due to the fact that AI workloads are spawning more traditional compute, so more build out is

necessary.

I think going forward, one of the things that we see is there is more of a desire for the latest generation. And so,

as much as we're happy with how Turin is ramping, we're seeing actually a strong pull on Venice and a lot of

early engagement in Venice, which kind of says a lot about the importance of general purpose compute at this

point in time.

certainly one where our plans are to work deeply together on hardware as well as software as well as systems

and future roadmap. And from that standpoint, the work that we're doing together with them on Triton is-- it's

certainly very valuable.

But I will say, beyond OpenAI, the work that we do with all of our largest customers are super helpful to

strengthening the software stack. And we have put significant new resources into not just the largest customers,

but we are working with a broad set of AI native companies who are actively developing on the ROCm stack. We

get lots of feedback. I think we've made significant progress in the training and inference stack. And we're going

to continue to double down and triple down in this area.

So the more customers that use AMD, I think all of that goes to enhancing the ROCm stack. And, we're actually--

we'll talk a little bit more about this next week, but we're also using AI to help us accelerate the rate and pace of

some of the ROCm kernel development, and just the overall ecosystem.

ANTOINE

to get on the latest and greatest GPUs when you're building new data center infrastructure. And certainly, when

we're looking at MI355, they're often going into new liquid cooled facilities, MI450 series as well.

But then we're also seeing the other trend, which is there's just a need for more AI compute. And from that

standpoint, some of the older generations-- MI300X is still doing quite well in terms of just where we see people

LISA  SU:

Sure, Joe. So, look, it's still a pretty dynamic situation with MI308. So that's the reason that we did not include any

MI308 revenue in the Q4 guide. We have received some licenses for MI308. So we're appreciative of the

differentiate in there? When you see that big customer signing deals with other GPU vendors and ASIC vendors,

et cetera, how do you attack that market differently than those competitors to not only get the 6 gigawatt

initially, but hopefully more after that?",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_2025Q4_Transcript.pdf,AMD 2025Q4 Transcript,2025.0,Q4,2025-11-24,52,LISA  SU,prepared_remarks,"Sure, Ross. Well, look, what I see is actually this environment where the world needs more AI compute. And from

that standpoint, I think OpenAI has kind of led in the quest for more AI compute. But they're not alone. I think

when you look across the large customers, there is really a demand for more AI compute as you go forward over

the next couple of years. I think we each have our advantages in terms of how we are positioning our products. I

think MI450 series, in particular, I think is an extremely strong product, Rack Scale Solution.

Overall, when we look at compute performance, when we look at memory performance, we think it's extremely

well-positioned for both inference as well as training. I think the key here is time to market, its total cost of

ownership, its deep partnership. And thinking about not just MI450 series, but what happens after that. So we're

deep in conversations on MI500 and beyond.

And we certainly think we're well-positioned to not only participate but participate in a very meaningful way

across the demand environment here. And I think we have certainly learned a ton over the last couple of years

with our AI roadmap. We've made significant inroads in terms of just what the largest customer needs from a

workload standpoint. So I'm pretty optimistic about our ability to capture a significant piece of this market going

forward.

everybody happy. Do you think that was a relatively unique agreement, or given that the world needs more

processing power, that AMD is open to somewhat similar, conceptually similar creative ways to address that

demand over time with other equity, vehicles, et cetera?",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_2025Q4_Transcript.pdf,AMD 2025Q4 Transcript,2025.0,Q4,2025-11-24,54,LISA  SU,prepared_remarks,"Sure, Ross. So I would say it was a unique agreement from the standpoint that, unique time in AI, what we

wanted, what we prioritized was really deep partnership and multiyear, multi-generation significant scale. And I

think we got that. We got a structure that has extremely aligned incentives. Everybody wins. We win, OpenAI

wins, and our shareholder win, sort of benefits from this. And all of that accrues to the overall roadmap.

I think as we look forward-- I think we have a lot of very interesting partnerships that are developing, whether

they're with the largest AI users, or you think about sovereign AI opportunities. And we look at each one of these

as a unique opportunity where we're bringing the whole of AMD, both technically as well as all the rest of our

capabilities, to the parties. So I would say OpenAI was pretty unique, but I would imagine that there are lots of

data/raw/AMD_Transcript.pdf,AMD Transcript,,,2025-11-24,3,LISA  SU,prepared_remarks,"Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. We delivered an outstanding quarter with

record revenue and profitability reflecting broad-based demand across our data center AI, server and PC

businesses.

Revenue grew 36% year over year to $9.2 billion, net income rose 31%, and free cash flow more than tripled, led

by record EPYC, Ryzen and Instinct processor sales. Our record third quarter performance marks a clear step up

in our growth trajectory, as the combination of our expanding compute franchise and rapidly scaling data center

AI business drives significant revenue and earnings growth.

Turning to our segments. Data center segment revenue increased 22% year over year to a record $4.3 billion,

led by the ramp of our Instinct MI350 series GPUs and server share gains. Server CPU revenue reached an all-

time high, as adoption of fifth Gen EPYC turn processors accelerated rapidly, accounting for nearly half of overall

EPYC revenue in the quarter. Sales of our prior generation EPYC processors were also very robust in the quarter,

reflecting their strong competitive positioning across a wide range of workloads.

In cloud, we had record sales as hyperscalers expanded EPYC CPU deployments to power both their own first

party services and public cloud offerings. Hyperscalers launched more than 160 EPYC powered instances in the

quarter, including new turn offerings from Google, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba and others that deliver unmatched

performance and price performance across a wide range of workloads. There are now more than 1,350 public

EPYC cloud instances available globally, a nearly 50% increase from a year ago.

Adoption of EPYC in cloud by large businesses more than tripled year over year, as our on-prem share gains are

driving increased demand from enterprise customers for AMD cloud instances to support hybrid compute. We

expect cloud demand to remain very strong as hyperscalers are significantly increasing their general purpose

compute capacity as they scale their AI workloads. Many customers are now planning substantially larger CPU

build outs over the coming quarters to support increased demands from AI, serving as a powerful new catalyst

for our server business.

Turning to enterprise adoption, EPYC server sell through increased sharply year over year and sequentially,

reflecting accelerating enterprise adoption. More than 175th Gen EPYC platforms are in market from HPE, Dell,

Lenovo, Supermicro, and others. Our broadest portfolio to date, with solutions optimized for virtually every

enterprise workload.

We closed large new wins in the quarter with leading fortune 500 technology, telecom, financial services, retail,

streaming, social and automotive companies as we expand our footprint across major verticals. The performance

in TCO advantages of our EPYC portfolio, combined with our increased go to market investments and the

expanded breadth of offerings from the leading server and solutions providers, positioned us well for continued

enterprise share gains.

Looking ahead, we remain on track to launch our next generation 2 nanometer Venice processors in 2026.

Venice Silicon is in the labs and performing very well, delivering substantial gains in performance, efficiency and

compute density. Customer pull and engagement for Venice are the strongest we have seen, reflecting our

competitive positioning and the growing demand for more data center compute. Multiple cloud OEM partners

have already brought their first Venice platforms online, setting the stage for broad solution availability and cloud

deployments at launch.

Turning to data center AI. Our instinct GPU business continues to accelerate. Revenue grew year over year,

driven by the sharp ramp of MI350 series GPU sales and broader MI300 series deployments. Multiple MI350 series

deployments are underway, with large cloud and AI providers, with additional large scale rollouts on track to

ramp over the coming quarters.

Oracle became the first hyperscaler to publicly offer MI355x instances, delivering significantly higher

performance for real-time inference and multimodal training workloads on OCI Zettascale SuperCluster. Neocloud

providers Crusoe, DigitalOcean, TensorWave, Vultr and others also began ramping availability of their MI350

series public cloud offerings in the quarter.

MI300 series GPU deployments with AI developers also broadened in the quarter. IBM and Zyphra will train

multiple generations of future multimodal models on a large scale MI300X cluster. And Cohere is now using

MI300X at OCI to train its command family of models. For inference, a number of new partners, including

character AI and Luma AI, are now running production workloads on MI300 series, demonstrating the

performance and TCO advantages of our architecture for real-time AI applications.

We also made significant progress on the software front in the quarter. We launched ROCm 7, our most

advanced and feature-rich release to date, delivering up to 4.6x higher inference and 3x higher training

performance compared to ROCm 6. ROCm 7 also introduces seamless distributed inference, enhanced code

portability across hardware, and new enterprise tools that simplify the deployment and management of instinct

solutions. Importantly, our open software strategy is resonating with developers Hugging Face VLM, SG Lang, and

others contributed directly to ROCm 7 as we make ROCm the open platform for AI development at scale.

Looking ahead, our data center AI business is entering its next phase of growth, with customer momentum

building rapidly ahead of the launch of our next Gen MI400 series accelerators and Helios Rack scale solutions in

2026. The MI400 series combines a new Compute Engine with industry leading memory capacity and advanced

networking capabilities to deliver a major leap in performance for the most demanding AI training and inference

workloads.

The MI400 series brings together our silicon software and systems expertise to power Helios. Our rack scale AI

platform designed to redefine performance and efficiency at data center scale. Helios integrates our instinct

MI400 series GPUs, Venice EPYC CPUs, and Pensando NICs in a double-wide rack solution optimized for the

performance, power, cooling, and serviceability required for the next generation of AI infrastructure, and

supports Meta's new open rack wide standard.

Development of both our MI400 series GPUs and Helios rack is progressing rapidly. Supported by deep technical

engagements across a growing set of hyperscalers, AI companies, and OEM and ODM partners to enable large

scale deployments next year. The ZT systems team, we acquired last year is playing a critical role in Helios

development, leveraging their decades of experience building infrastructure for the world's largest cloud

providers to ensure customers can deploy and scale Helios quickly within their environments.

In addition, last week, we completed the sale of the ZT manufacturing business to Sanmina and entered a

strategic partnership that makes them our lead manufacturing partner for Helios. This collaboration will

accelerate large customer deployments of our rack scale AI solutions.

On the customer front, we announced a comprehensive multiyear agreement with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts

of Instinct GPUs with the first gigawatt of MI450 series accelerators scheduled to start coming online in the

second half of 2026. The partnership establishes AMD as a core compute provider for OpenAI and underscores

the strength of our hardware, software, and full stack solutions strategy.

Moving forward, AMD and OpenAI will work even more closely on future hardware, software, networking, and

system level roadmaps and technologies. OpenAI's decision to use AMD Instinct platforms for its most

sophisticated and complex AI workloads sends a clear signal that our Instinct GPUs and ROCm open software

stack deliver the performance and TCO required for the most demanding deployments. We expect this

partnership will significantly accelerate our data center AI business, with the potential to generate well over $100

billion in revenue over the next few years.

Oracle announced they will also be a lead launch partner for the MI450 series, deploying tens of thousands of

MI450 GPUs across Oracle Cloud Infrastructure beginning in 2026 and expanding through 2027 and beyond. Our

Instinct platforms are also gaining traction with sovereign AI and national supercomputing programs.

In the UAE, Cisco and G42 will deploy a large scale AI cluster powered by Instinct MI350X GPUs to support the

nation's most advanced AI workloads. In the US, we are partnering with the Department of Energy and Oak Ridge

National Labs to build LuxAI, the first AI factory dedicated to scientific discovery, together with our industrial

partners OCI and HPE. Powered by our Instinct MI350 series GPUs, EPYC CPUs, and Pensando networking, LuxAI

will provide a secure, open platform for large scale training and distributed inference when it comes online in

early 2026.

The US Department of Energy also selected our upcoming MI430X GPUs and EPYC Zen CPUs to power discovery,

the next flagship supercomputer at Oak Ridge designed to set the standard for AI-driven scientific computing and

extend US high performance computing leadership. Our MI430X GPUs are designed specifically to power nation

scale AI and supercomputing programs, extending our leadership, powering the world's most powerful computers

to enable the next generation of scientific breakthroughs.

In summary, our AI business is entering a new phase of growth and is on a clear trajectory towards tens of

billions in annual revenue in 2027, driven by our leadership rack scale solutions, expanding customer adoption,

and an increasing number of large scale global deployments. I look forward to providing more details on our data

center AI growth plans at our financial analyst day next week.

In client and gaming, segment revenue increased 73% year over year to four billion. Our PC processor business

is performing exceptionally well, with record quarterly sales as the strong demand environment and breadth of

our leadership Ryzen portfolio accelerates growth. Desktop CPU sales reached an all-time high, with record

channel selling and sellout led by robust demand for Ryzen 9,000 processors, which deliver unmatched

performance across gaming productivity and content creation applications.

OEM sell through of Ryzen powered notebooks also increased sharply in the quarter, reflecting sustained end

customer pull for premium gaming and commercial AMD PCs. Commercial momentum accelerated in the quarter,

with rising PC sell through up more than 30% year over year as enterprise adoption grew sharply, driven by large

wins with Fortune 500 companies across healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, automotive and

pharmaceuticals.

Looking ahead, we see significant opportunity to continue growing our client business faster than the overall PC

market based on the strength of our Ryzen portfolio, broader platform coverage and expanded go to market

investments. In gaming, revenue increased 181% year over year to $1.3 billion. Semicustom revenue increased

as Sony and Microsoft prepare for the upcoming holiday sales period.

In gaming graphics, revenue and channel sellout grew significantly, driven by the performance per dollar

leadership of our Radeon 9000 family. FSR4, our machine learning upscaling technology that boosts frame rates

and creates more immersive visuals, saw rapid adoption this quarter, with the number of supported games

doubling since launch to more than 85.

Turning to our embedded segment. Revenue decreased 8% year over year to $857 million. Sequentially, revenue

and sell through increased as the demand environment strengthened across multiple markets, led by test and

emulation. Aerospace and defense, and industrial vision and healthcare.

We expanded our embedded product portfolio with new solutions that extend our leadership across adaptive and

x86 computing. We began shipping industry leading Versal prime series Gen 2 adaptive SoCs to lead customers,

delivered our first virtual RF development platforms to support several next generation design wins, and

introduced the Ryzen embedded 9000 series with industry leading performance per watt and latency for robotics,

edge computing, and smart factory applications.

The design momentum remains very strong across our embedded portfolio. We are on track for a second straight

year of record design wins already totaling more than $14 billion year to date, reflecting the growing adoption of

our leadership products across a broad range of markets and expanding set of applications.

In summary, our record third quarter results and strong fourth quarter outlook reflect the significant momentum

building across our business, driven by sustained product leadership and disciplined execution. Our data center

AI, server, and PC businesses are each entering periods of strong growth, led by an expanding TAM, accelerating

adoption of our instinct platforms and EPYC and Ryzen CPU share gains.

The demand for compute has never been greater, as every major breakthrough in business, science and society

now relies on access to more powerful, efficient, and intelligent computing. These trends are driving

unprecedented growth opportunities for AMD. I look forward to sharing more on our strategy, roadmaps, and

long range financial targets at our financial analyst meeting next week. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jean to

provide additional color on our third quarter results. Jean?",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_Transcript.pdf,AMD Transcript,,,2025-11-24,4,JEAN  HU,prepared_remarks,"Thank you, Lisa. And good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results, and then provide

our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. We're pleased with our strong third quarter financial results. We

delivered record revenue of $9.2 billion, up 36% year over year, exceeding the high-end of our guidance,

reflecting strong momentum across our business.

Our third quarter results do not include any revenue from shipments of the MI308 GPU products to China.

Revenue increased 20% sequentially, driven by strong growth in the data center and client and gaming segment

and modest growth in the embedded segment. Gross margin was 54% up 40 basis points year over year,

primarily driven by product mix.

Operating expenses were approximately $2.8 billion, an increase of 42% year over year as we continue to invest

aggressively in R&D to capitalize on significant AI opportunities and go to market activities for revenue growth.

Operating income was $2.2 billion, representing a 24% operating margin, taxes, interest expense, and other

totaled $273 million. For the third quarter of 2025, diluted earnings per share were $1.20 compared to $0.92 a

year ago, an increase of 30% year over year.

Now, turning to our reportable segments, starting with the data center. Data center segment revenue was a

record of $4.3 billion, up 22% year over year, primarily driven by the strong demand for fifth generation EPYC

processors and Instinct MI350 series GPUs. On a sequential basis, data center revenue increased 34% primarily

driven by strong ramp of our AMD Instinct MI350 series GPUs.

The data center segment operating income was $1.1 billion, or 25% of revenue, compared to $1 billion a year

ago, or 29% of revenue, driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment, to capitalize on

significant AI opportunities. Client and gaming segment revenue was a record of $4 billion, up 73% year over

year and 12% sequentially, driven by strong demand for the latest generation of client and graphics processors

and stronger sales of console gaming products.

In a client business, revenue was a record $2.8 billion, up 46% year over year and 10% sequentially, driven by

record sales of our Ryzen processors and the richer product mix. Gaming revenue rose to $1.3 billion, up 181%

year over year and 16% sequentially, reflecting higher semi-customer revenue and strong demand for our

Radeon GPUs. Client gaming segment operating income was $867 million, or 21% of revenue, compared to $288

million, or 12% a year ago, driven by higher revenue, partially offset by increase in go to market investment to

support our revenue growth.

Embedded segment revenue was $857 million, down 8% year over year. Embedded was up 4% sequentially as

we saw certain end market demand strengthen. Embedded segment operating income was $283 million, or 33%

of revenue, compared to $372 million, or 40% a year ago. The decline in operating income was primarily due to

lower revenue and end market mix.

Before I review the balance sheet and the cash flow, as a reminder, we closed the sale of ZT system and

manufacturing business to Sanmina last week. The third quarter financial results of the ZT manufacturing

business are reported separately in our financial statements as discontinued operations and are excluded from

our non-GAAP financials.

Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $1.8 billion in cash from operating

activities of continuing operations, and free cash flow was a record of $1.5 billion. We returned $89 million to

shareholders through share repurchases, resulting in $1.3 billion in share repurchases for the first three quarters

of 2025. Exiting the quarter, we have $1.4 billion authorization remaining under our share repurchase program.

At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment was $7.2 billion. Our total debt was

$3.2 billion.

Now turning to our fourth quarter 2025 outlook. Please note that our fourth quarter outlook does not include any

revenue from AMD Instinct MI308 shipment to China. For the fourth quarter of 2025, we expect revenue to be

approximately $9.6 billion plus or negative $300 million. The midpoint of our guidance represents approximately

25% year over year revenue growth, driven by strong double digit growth in our data center and client and

gaming segment, and the return to growth in our embedded segment.

Sequentially, we expect revenue to grow by approximately 4% driven by double digit growth in the data center

segment with strong growth in server and the continued ramp of our MI350 series GPUs. A decline in our client

gaming segment with client revenue increasing and gaming revenue down strong double digits, and the double

digit growth in our embedded segment.

In addition, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54.5%. And we expect non-

GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.8 billion. We expect net interest and other expenses to be a

gain of approximately $37 million. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%. And diluted share count

is expected to be approximately $1.65 billion shares.

In closing, we executed very well, delivering record revenue for the first three quarters of the year. The strategic

investments we are making positioned us well to capitalize on the expanding AI opportunities across all our end

markets, driving sustainable long-term revenue growth and earnings expansion for compelling shareholder value

creation. With that, I'll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session.",manual_drop

reminder that that was without any MI308 sales. The MI355 has ramped really nicely. We expected a sharp ramp

into the third quarter, and that proceeded well.

And as I mentioned, we've also seen some strengthening of the server CPU sales and not just-- let's call it near-

term, but we're seeing our customers are giving us some visibility in the next few quarters that they see

elevated demand, which is positive. Going into the fourth quarter, again, strong data center performance, up

double digits sequentially and up in both server and data center AI, again, on the strength of those businesses.

And to your question, I mean, we're not guiding into 2026 yet, obviously, but given what we see today, we see a

very good demand environment into 2026. So we would expect that MI355 continue to ramp in the first half '26

26. And then as we mentioned, MI450 series comes online in the second half of 2026, and we would expect a

sharper ramp as we go into the second half of 2026 of our data center AI business.",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_Transcript.pdf,AMD Transcript,,,2025-11-24,9,VIVEK  ARYA,prepared_remarks,"All right. And for my follow-up, there is some industry debate at least about OpenAI's ability to simultaneously

engage with all three merchant and the ASIC suppliers, just given the constraints around power and CapEx and

their existing CSP partners and so forth. So how are you thinking about that? What is your level of visibility in the

initial engagement? And then more importantly, how it kind of broadens out into '27? Is there a way that one can

model what the allocation would be, or just how should we think about the level of visibility in this very important

customer? Thank you.

LISA  SU:

Yeah, absolutely, Vivek. Look, we're very-- obviously very excited about our relationship with OpenAI. It's a very

significant relationship. Think about it as-- it's a pretty unique time for AI right now. There's just so much compute

demand across all of the workloads. I think in our work with OpenAI, we are planning, multiple quarters out,

ensuring that the power is available, that the supply chain is available.

The key point is the first gigawatt we will start deploying in the second half of '26. And that work is well

underway. And we continue-- just given where lead times are and things like that, we are planning very closely

with OpenAI as well as the CSP partners to ensure that we're all prepared with Helios so that we can deploy the

technology as we stated. So I think overall, we're working very closely together. I think we have good visibility

into the MI450 ramp. And things are progressing very well.",manual_drop

THOMAS

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good results. I had a first question on Helios,

O'MALLEY:

obviously with the announcement at OCP. Customer interaction has to be growing. Could you talk about into next

year, what your view is on discrete sales versus system sales? When do you see that crossover kind of

happening? And just what initial responses have been from customers after getting a better look at it at the

show?",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_Transcript.pdf,AMD Transcript,,,2025-11-24,11,LISA  SU,prepared_remarks,"Yeah, sure. Tom, thanks for the question. There's a lot of excitement around MI450 in Helios. I think the OCP

reception was phenomenal. We had numerous customers and frankly, bringing their engineering teams to

understand more about the system, more about how it's built.

There's always been some discussion about just how complex these Rack Scale systems are, and they certainly

are. And we are very proud of the Helios design. I think it has all of the features, functions, reliability,

performance, power performance, that you would expect. I think the interest in MI450 and Helios has just

expanded over the last number of weeks, certainly with some of the announcements that we've made with

OpenAI and OCI, as well as the OCP show with Meta.

I think, overall, from our perspective, I think things are going, really well in both the development as well as the

customer engagement there. So in terms of Rack Scale Solutions, we would expect that the early customers for

MI450 will really be around the rack scale solutions. We will have other form factors as well for the MI450 series,

but there's a lot of interest in the full Rack Scale Solution.

THOMAS

Super helpful. And then as my follow up, it's a broader question as well and similar to what Vivek asked. But if

O'MALLEY:

you look at the power requirements that are out there for some of the early announcements into next year,

they're pretty substantial. And then you also have component issues that you're seeing across interconnected

memory.

Just from your perspective as an industry leader, where do you think that the constraint will be? Will it come first

with components not being available, or do you think that both data center footprint in terms of infrastructure

and/or power, is the gating factor to some of these deployments into next year, just as we really see some larger

numbers start to get deployed? Thank you.

LISA  SU:

Yeah, sure, Tom. I think what you're pointing out is what we, as an industry, have to do together. The entire

ecosystem has to plan together. And that is exactly what we're doing. So we're working with our customers on

their power plans over the next, actually, I would say two years from a silicon and a memory and a packaging

and a component supply chain. We're working with our supply chain partners to make sure all of that capacity is

available.

I can tell you from our visibility, we feel very good that we have a strong supply chain that is prepared to deliver

these very significant growth rates and large amounts of compute that is out there. And I think all of this is going

to be tight. I think there is a-- you can see from some of the CapEx spending that there's a desire to put on more

compute, and we're working closely together.

I will say that the ecosystem is very, I would say, works very hard when there are these types of let's call it

tightness out there. And so we also see things open up as we're working-- getting more power, getting more

supply, all of those things. So the net-net is, I think, we are well-positioned to grow significantly as we transition

into the second half of '26 into '27 with the MI450 and Helios.",manual_drop

Maybe you could speak to the sustainability of these trends. And they called out supply constraints. Are you

seeing any of those in your supply chain? And are we in a period where we should think about the CPU business

on the data center side as being a seasonal, or should we expect normal seasonality in the first half of next year?

Thank you.",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_Transcript.pdf,AMD Transcript,,,2025-11-24,14,LISA  SU,prepared_remarks,"Sure, Josh. So a couple of comments on the CPU server side. I think we've been watching this trend for the last

couple of quarters. And we started seeing, let's call it, some positive signs in CPU demand actually a couple of

quarters ago. And what's happened as we've gone through 2025 is now we see a broadening of that CPU

demand. So we have-- a number of our large hyperscale clients are now forecasting significant CPU build into

2026.

And so from that standpoint, I think it's a positive demand environment. And it is because AI is requiring quite a

bit of general purpose compute. And that's great. It catches our cycle as we're ramping turn. So the turn ramp

has gone extremely fast. And we see good pull for that product as well as consistent strong demand for our

general product line as well.

So back to seasonality as we go into 2026. I think we expect that the CPU demand environment into 2026 is

going to be, let's call it positive. And so we'll guide more as we get into the end of the year, but I would expect a

positive demand environment for CPUs as we see this demand. I do feel like it's durable. It is not a short-term

thing. I think it is a multi-quarter phenomenon, as we're seeing just much more demand as these AI workloads

really turn into-- you have to do real work.",manual_drop

forward in terms of performance and all the frameworks that we support. It's been a really, really important for

us to get day 0 support of all the newest models and native support for all the newest frameworks. I would say

most customers who are starting with AMD now have a very smooth experience as they're bringing on their

workloads to AMD.

There's obviously always more work to do. We're continuing to augment the libraries and the overall environment

that we have, especially as we go to some of the newer workloads, where you see training and inference really

coming together with reinforcement learning. But overall, I think very strong progress with ROCm. And by the

way, we're going to continue to invest in this area, because it's so important to really make our customer

gross margin continued to improve when we ramped a new generation of products. Typically at the beginning of

the ramp, you go through a transition period, then you will normalize the gross margin. We're not guiding 2026,

some maybe higher level points. Look, I think we're really excited about our roadmap. I think we have seen great

traction amongst the largest customers.

The OpenAI relationship is extremely important to us, and it's great to be able to talk at the multi-gigawatt scale

because I think that really is what we believe we can deliver to the marketplace. But there are numerous other

customers that we're in deep engagements with. We talked about OCI. We also announced a couple of systems

with the Department of Energy that are significant systems. And, we have many other engagements.

So the way you should think about it is, there are multiple customers that we would expect to have, let's call it,

very significant scale in the MI450 generation. And that's the breadth of the customer engagements that we've

built. And it's also how we're dimensioning the supply chain to ensure that we can supply certainly our OpenAI

think about what you mean by strong double digits? Because again, I'm trying to-- I mean, for the GPUs for the

Thanks a lot. Lisa, I know it's only been a month since you announced this deal with OpenAI, but can you give us",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_Transcript.pdf,AMD Transcript,,,2025-11-24,33,ARCURI,prepared_remarks,"maybe some anecdotes of how this has influenced your position in the market with other customers? Are you

engaged with customers that you wouldn't have been engaged with if you hadn't done this deal?

That's the first part of the question. And then the second part relates to a prior question, which is that it looks like

they could be something like half of your data center GPU revenue in the 2027, 2028 frame. So how much risk in

your mind is there around that single customer for you?

LISA  SU:

Sure, Tim. So let me say a couple of things. First of all, the OpenAI deal has been in the works for quite some

time. We're happy to be able to talk about it broadly, and also talk about the scale of the deployment and the

scale of the engagement being multi-year, multi gigawatt. I think all those things were very positive.

We've had a number of other engagements as well. I think over the last-- if you were asked to ask specifically

over the last month, I would say that it's been a number of factors. I think the OpenAI deal was one of them. I

think having-- being able to show the Helios rack in full force at open compute was also a very important

milestone, because people could see the engineering and the capabilities of the Helios rack. And if you're asking

whether we've seen a increase of interest or an acceleration of interest, I think the answer is yes.

I think customers are broadly engaged and perhaps broadly engaged at a higher scale, which is a good thing.

And then from the standpoint of customer concentration, I think a very key foundation for us in this business is to

have a broad set of customers. We've always been engaged with a number of customers. I think we're

dimensioning the supply chain in such a way that we would have ample supply to have multiple customers at

similar scale as we go into the '27-'28 time frame. And that's certainly the goal.",manual_drop

your question.

AARON

Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. I'm curious on the server strength that you're seeing, if there's a way to",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_Transcript.pdf,AMD Transcript,,,2025-11-24,35,RAKERSI,prepared_remarks,"unpack how we think about unit growth versus ASP expansion as we move through the Turin product cycle. And

how do you guys just think about that going forward?",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_Transcript.pdf,AMD Transcript,,,2025-11-24,36,LISA  SU,prepared_remarks,"Yeah. So Aaron, on the server CPU side, Turin certainly is more content. So we see ASPs grow as Turin ramps. But

I also mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're actually seeing a good mix of Genoa still there. So Turin is

ramping up very quickly, but we are also seeing Genoa demand continue well as-- the hyperscalers are not able

to move everything to the latest generation immediately.

So from our standpoint, I think it's broad-based CPU demand across a number of different workloads. This is-- a

little bit of this is, let's call it, server refresh. But it seems like, from our customer conversations, the workloads

are broadly due to the fact that AI workloads are spawning more traditional compute, so more build out is

necessary.

I think going forward, one of the things that we see is there is more of a desire for the latest generation. And so,

as much as we're happy with how Turin is ramping, we're seeing actually a strong pull on Venice and a lot of

early engagement in Venice, which kind of says a lot about the importance of general purpose compute at this

point in time.

AARON

Yeah, thanks. As a quick follow-up, I'm curious and not to steal, maybe you know the discussion from next week.",manual_drop

Well, Aaron, as you said, not to take too much away from what we're going to talk about next week. Look, we're

going to give you a full picture of how we see the market next week. But suffice it to say, from everything that we

see, we see the AI compute TAM just going up. So we'll have some updated numbers for you. But the view is,

ANTOINE

Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. So I'd like to ask about whether the developing relationship with",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_Transcript.pdf,AMD Transcript,,,2025-11-24,39,CHKAIBAN,prepared_remarks,"OpenAI could be a tailwind to the development of your software stack. Can you maybe tell us about how the

collaboration works in practice, and whether the partnership contributed in making ROCm more robust?",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_Transcript.pdf,AMD Transcript,,,2025-11-24,40,LISA  SU,prepared_remarks,"Yeah, Antoine, thanks for the question. I think the answer is yes. I think all of our large customers contribute to,

let's call it, a broadening and deepening of our software stack. Overall, I think the relationship with OpenAI is

certainly one where our plans are to work deeply together on hardware as well as software as well as systems

and future roadmap. And from that standpoint, the work that we're doing together with them on Triton is-- it's

certainly very valuable.

But I will say, beyond OpenAI, the work that we do with all of our largest customers are super helpful to

strengthening the software stack. And we have put significant new resources into not just the largest customers,

but we are working with a broad set of AI native companies who are actively developing on the ROCm stack. We

get lots of feedback. I think we've made significant progress in the training and inference stack. And we're going

to continue to double down and triple down in this area.

So the more customers that use AMD, I think all of that goes to enhancing the ROCm stack. And, we're actually--

we'll talk a little bit more about this next week, but we're also using AI to help us accelerate the rate and pace of

some of the ROCm kernel development, and just the overall ecosystem.

ANTOINE

Thanks, Lisa. Maybe as a quick follow-up, could you tell us about the useful lives of GPUs? I know that most CSPs",manual_drop

data/raw/AMD_Transcript.pdf,AMD Transcript,,,2025-11-24,42,LISA  SU,prepared_remarks,"I think we have seen some early indications of that, Antoine. I think the key point being-- clearly, there's a desire

to get on the latest and greatest GPUs when you're building new data center infrastructure. And certainly, when

we're looking at MI355, they're often going into new liquid cooled facilities, MI450 series as well.

But then we're also seeing the other trend, which is there's just a need for more AI compute. And from that

standpoint, some of the older generations-- MI300X is still doing quite well in terms of just where we see people

deploying and using us, especially for inference. And from that standpoint, I think you see a little bit of both.",manual_drop

ROSS

Thanks for squeezing me in. Lisa, this might take longer than the amount of time you have left before the top of",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_Transcript.pdf,AMD Transcript,,,2025-11-24,51,SEYMORE,prepared_remarks,"the hour, but there's been so many of these multigigawatt announcements from OpenAI. How does AMD truly

differentiate in there? When you see that big customer signing deals with other GPU vendors and ASIC vendors,

et cetera, how do you attack that market differently than those competitors to not only get the 6 gigawatt

initially, but hopefully more after that?",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_Transcript.pdf,AMD Transcript,,,2025-11-24,52,LISA  SU,prepared_remarks,"Sure, Ross. Well, look, what I see is actually this environment where the world needs more AI compute. And from

that standpoint, I think OpenAI has kind of led in the quest for more AI compute. But they're not alone. I think

when you look across the large customers, there is really a demand for more AI compute as you go forward over

the next couple of years. I think we each have our advantages in terms of how we are positioning our products. I

think MI450 series, in particular, I think is an extremely strong product, Rack Scale Solution.

Overall, when we look at compute performance, when we look at memory performance, we think it's extremely

well-positioned for both inference as well as training. I think the key here is time to market, its total cost of

ownership, its deep partnership. And thinking about not just MI450 series, but what happens after that. So we're

deep in conversations on MI500 and beyond.

And we certainly think we're well-positioned to not only participate but participate in a very meaningful way

across the demand environment here. And I think we have certainly learned a ton over the last couple of years

with our AI roadmap. We've made significant inroads in terms of just what the largest customer needs from a

workload standpoint. So I'm pretty optimistic about our ability to capture a significant piece of this market going

forward.

ROSS

And I guess as my follow-up, it'll be a direct follow on to that. You did a unique structure by granting some",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_Transcript.pdf,AMD Transcript,,,2025-11-24,53,SEYMORE,prepared_remarks,"warrants with this deal. And I know they vest according to a price that would be very accretive and make

everybody happy. Do you think that was a relatively unique agreement, or given that the world needs more

processing power, that AMD is open to somewhat similar, conceptually similar creative ways to address that

demand over time with other equity, vehicles, et cetera?",manual_drop
data/raw/AMD_Transcript.pdf,AMD Transcript,,,2025-11-24,54,LISA  SU,prepared_remarks,"Sure, Ross. So I would say it was a unique agreement from the standpoint that, unique time in AI, what we

wanted, what we prioritized was really deep partnership and multiyear, multi-generation significant scale. And I

think we got that. We got a structure that has extremely aligned incentives. Everybody wins. We win, OpenAI

wins, and our shareholder win, sort of benefits from this. And all of that accrues to the overall roadmap.

I think as we look forward-- I think we have a lot of very interesting partnerships that are developing, whether

they're with the largest AI users, or you think about sovereign AI opportunities. And we look at each one of these

as a unique opportunity where we're bringing the whole of AMD, both technically as well as all the rest of our

capabilities, to the parties. So I would say OpenAI was pretty unique, but I would imagine that there are lots of

Overview.

Content accounting standards.

We use two accounting standards for our content costs. Since we launched streaming in 2007, we
have used the guidance of ASC 920: Entertainment - Broadcasters because we started the
streaming service with content that we license (rather than own).

● We license both Netﬂix originals (such as Wednesday and Emily in Paris) as well as 2nd run

titles, such as Shameless and The Blacklist

In 2016, we also began applying the guidance of ASC 926: Entertainment - Films for the original
content that we produce and where we own the intellectual property.

● We believe the beneﬁts of self-producing content include lower costs (no studio

middle-man), ownership of the intellectual property, which allows us to potentially monetize
in diﬀerent ways (e.g., licensing & merchandising) and greater rights ﬂexibility (global rights,
exclusivity)

In 2019, we adopted the update (ASU 2019-2) to accounting standards ASC 920 and 926. There
was no material impact as our accounting policies were already consistent with the new rules.

Amortization methodology.

●

The amortization schedule for content is based on historical and estimated viewing patterns
and is reviewed quarterly.

● All titles in our content library are amortized on an accelerated basis.

● Content assets are amortized over the shorter of the title’s window of availability, estimated

useful life, or 10 years.

● On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced streaming content asset is expected to be

amortized within four years after its launch.

●

First run topical programming, like sports, talk shows and other live events, is expensed upon
airing.

Criteria for ASC 920.

ASC 920 speciﬁes that a broadcaster shall account for a license agreement for program material
as a purchase of rights

Under ASC 920, the following 3 criteria must be met in order for the content we license to qualify
for asset recognition:

●
●
●

The cost of each title is known or reasonably determinable
The title (source ﬁle) has been received
The title is available for ﬁrst showing

9

We use ASC 926 for produced assets.

For content that we produce, we capitalize the costs associated with production, including
development cost, direct costs and production overhead. These amounts and licensed content
are included in “Content assets, net” and classiﬁed as non-current assets on our balance sheet in
accordance with ASU 2019-2.

Income statement

● Content assets are amortized over the shorter of the title’s window of availability, estimated

● Amortization expense is recorded in cost of revenues

Cash Flow Statement

● Additions to content assets = total gross additions (not cash paid)
● Change in content liabilities = net change in liabilities resulting from payments and asset

additions, both current and non-current

● Amortization of content assets = adjusts for the non-cash expense included in net income

Amortization expense disclosure.

(1) Tax incentives earned on qualified production spend generally reduce the cost-basis of content assets and result in lower content amortization over the life of the title. For the years
ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, tax incentives resulted in lower content amortization on produced content of approximately $899 million, $835 million and $719 million,
respectively.

16

Content Obligations.

Content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of
content. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under
creative talent and employment agreements, as well as other production related commitments. An
obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an
agreement to obtain future titles.

●

These obligations reﬂect content costs that will be amortized to the income statement in the
future once the 3 criteria for ASC 920 are met.

● Disney and Fox have similar obligations related to their programming commitments.

Those that are not reﬂected on the balance sheet do not yet meet asset recognition criteria (see
slide 9) and:

Either will never meet asset recognition criteria because cost per title is unknown, or

●
● Cost per title is known but titles are not yet available for showing.

17

Content Obligations (cont’d).

18

Content Obligations.

●

●

Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate
quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date and are not
included in content obligations. Traditional ﬁlm output deals or certain TV series license
agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of
agreements.

These unknown obligations are expected to be signiﬁcant and we believe could include
approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast
majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. Once we know the title
that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table.

19

Impact on
Cash Flow.

20

Cash costs for original content are
more front end loaded.

● For produced original content, we often fund the production costs during the

content creation process prior to completion and release on the Netﬂix service.
This could be years in advance of a release date.

● This also creates a content asset with a useful life well into the future.
● For licensed originals, cash payment terms also generally exceed expense in the

early years.

● Payment for second window and catalog licensed content is generally upon

delivery and over the window of availability.

21

Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ).

22

FAQ.

You have discussed your ratio of cash spending on content to P&L spending on
content. What does this refer to?

●

●

This ratio is our cash spending on content (as derived from our cash ﬂow
statement) divided by our content amortization (which ﬂows through our income
statement)
This ratio is an indicator of the timing diﬀerences between cash payment terms
on content vs. the content expense recognition

● Cash payments are more front-loaded, especially for produced content which we
must fund during the production process before the content is completed and
available for viewing

23

FAQ (continued).

How do I calculate your cash spending on content?

● Cash spending on content can be derived from our cash ﬂow statement. The
sum of Additions to Content Assets and the Change in Content Liabilities
equates to our cash spending on content

~$17.0 bil. in cash spent
on content in FY24 vs.
$15.3 bil. in content
amortization, resulting in
a 1.1x ratio of cash spend
on content to content
amort. ratio

24

FAQ (continued).

Can I divide your content amortization by your content library to derive an
indication of your average amortization term or changes in your amortization
schedules?

● No, because our content library is presented net of amortization, not on a

gross basis

● On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced streaming content asset is

expected to be amortized within four years after its launch.

● Our amortization in any given period is also aﬀected by the mix of content as

diﬀerent categories of content are amortized on diﬀerent schedules (based
on historical and estimated viewing patterns)

25

FAQ (continued).

What is your process for determining possible impairment of your content library?

● Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group

and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in
circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or
that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost.

● We also review at a title level if a speciﬁc title is pulled down permanently or

expected to be abandoned.

● Content assets are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value if an

impairment is identiﬁed.

26

FAQ (continued).

Are there other non-amortization content costs in cost of revenue on your income
statement?

●

●

●

Yes, our cost of revenues also include other content costs that are not classiﬁed
as amortization.
These costs include content personnel costs, portions of our overall deals with
certain content creators, music rights and miscellaneous expenses related to
production.
In addition, other cost of revenue include streaming delivery expenses and other
operating costs like payment processing and customer service and other costs
involved in making our content available to members

TALENT PIPELINE STRATEGY

Our multifaceted talent pipeline is built by our

central Talent Acquisition Sourcing team,

particularly within areas experiencing growth and/

or attrition. This allows us to create a hiring forecast

to fulfill upcoming talent needs and develop diverse

and functional pools of talent with the skill sets

needed across our technology, creative, and

corporate businesses.

Championing inclusion is central to our talent-

acquisition philosophy. It is woven into our end-to-

end talent attraction strategy and recruiting

processes, from our candidate sourcing strategies

and recruiting processes to the partnerships,

platforms, and tools we invest in.

To further drive meaningful impact, we have

Employee engagement and retention is crucial to WBD. We aim to

promote an open feedback culture and foster a thriving and

continuously evolving workforce by establishing touchpoints through

surveys spanning the entire employee lifecycle. This includes:

•

Annual employee engagement survey

• Candidate experience survey

• Onboarding survey

• Exit survey

• Targeted ad-hoc surveys addressing specific initiatives

important factor guiding decision-making related to employee retention

and other people-related strategies. Analyzing employee departures

and combining that with the exit survey insights enables us to

continually refine and enhance our approaches to talent retention.

 Labor Relations

We recognize that we need all our creative partners to feel valued and

rewarded, and that we must be flexible and adaptable to focus on telling

great stories. As one of the world’s leading producers of film and

television content, WBD entities such as Warner Bros. Television, Warner

Our efforts to make diverse stories created by diverse voices are fueled by our increased

investment in pipeline programs. In 2023, we focused on expanding the scope of global and

regional programs for underrepresented creatives, which includes greater emphasis on

training and placement in the WBD ecosystem.

Our initiatives include:

Talent Acquisition Diversity Outreach: Our Talent Acquisition Diversity Outreach team was
established with the primary responsibility of recruiting diverse talent and building diverse

talent pools. We utilize strategic partnerships across core functional areas, as well as

in-house initiatives designed to attract underrepresented talent communities.

Investments in Tools and Technologies: We invest in a number of diversity-focused
technologies, providing access to diverse talent databases and allowing us to further

optimize our diverse talent pools.

Implement Selection and Assessment Processes: Our selection and assessment
process is designed to eliminate bias throughout the recruitment process in a number

of ways:

•

Required Interview and Feedback Training: For all interviewers, covering the end-to-end

WBD recruiting process and inclusive hiring philosophy: “The Hiring Playbook Simplified.”

• Standardized Recruiting Loops: Assessing candidates across a range of competencies

aligned with the functional requirements of the role, as well as alignment with our Guiding

Principles (core values).

• “Blind” Debriefs: Unbiased feedback sessions in which assessors are required to submit

written candidate feedback and a recommendation for hire or no hire ahead of a formal

debrief to avoid unintended influence from other interviewers.

• Offers are extended based on aggregate feedback and recommendations.

Neurodiversity: TVN produced the Polish version of The A Talks, the groundbreaking

French format featuring 50 individuals living on the autism spectrum trying their hand

at journalism and interviewing well-known personalities. The Polish title Autentyczni

(The Authentic) was aired in primetime in November and was very well-received by the

audience. The program’s launch was also accompanied by a social autism spectrum

disorder–awareness campaign.

LGBTQ+: TVN24 is the only leading news channel in Poland that regularly addresses

the challenges faced by the LGBTQ+ community. This includes the multi-awarded

to drive positive change. As a media company, our impact on this issue is limited. Therefore,

we focus our efforts where we have the most significant opportunities for progress,

balanced with investments in a range of critical ESG issues. We are committed to lowering

our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, investing in clean energy, and telling stories that will

In 2024, we will continue our efforts to reduce emissions, for example, increasing energy

efficiency and exploring renewable energy projects and the potential purchase of

Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and carbon offsets, where appropriate. We will also

evaluate the opportunity to set enterprise-level GHG emissions reduction goals, supported

by a roadmap to ensure we can deliver on our commitments.

We believe these efforts are important to the ongoing success of our business as a

Flexible working also leads to a substantial reduction in

WASTE REDUCTION

WBD is committed to identifying ways to further reduce

waste in our business operations. Our initiatives to

reduce and divert waste around the globe save

resources and reduce our GHG emissions. We focus on

source reduction; reusing materials, including donating

production materials and other lightly used materials;

recycling materials; and composting organics and

donating leftover food. We are working to reduce single-

use materials and divert waste through recycling and

composting across our studios and offices.

WATER MANAGEMENT

We are committed to identifying ways to reduce water

use in our business operations. For example, at our

Burbank studio, we utilize reclaimed water for our

landscaping irrigation and cooling towers and are

reducing consumption of reclaimed water by installing

a water softener for a cooling tower. Additionally, there

are stormwater infiltration systems in place that utilize

slow infiltration that allows water to slowly seep into

the ground.

Additionally, the production team for WBD’s 2023 film

Barbie made efforts to incorporate sustainability

throughout the project. To reduce reliance on generators,

approximately 85% of all power used during the U.K. shoot

came from house power and the vast majority of this was

used at Warner Bros. Studio Leavesden, which operates on

a 100% renewable energy tariff. Further, production used

many items that were handed down from other

productions and were donated to various sources once

they were at the end of their useful life within the industry.

For instance, rigging silks that could not be used by

projects. The majority of costumes were purchased

second hand and then returned to charity shops for resale.

Production also donated personal protective equipment

use environmentally-friendlier packaging

for merchandise sold at its three Harry

Potter London retail outlets (The Harry

Potter Shop at Platform 9 ¾ - Kings Cross

and Heathrow - and the Warner Bros.

Studio Tour London: The Making of Harry

Potter) and at its New York store.

Examples of efforts the WBSO team is

making to reduce the environmental

impact of products include:

•  Working with the supply base to switch to

FSC-quality paper-based packaging in

items such as swing tags or riders to hold

badges and key rings.

•  Reducing plastic packaging, where

possible, by switching to paper-based or

reusable packaging and, where plastic is

used, encouraging that it is made from at

least 30% recycled materials.

•  Utilizing sustainable cotton on self-

developed apparel lines.

•  Encouraging the use of recycled polyester

in place of polyester fabric in Softline

products (e.g., apparel and stuffing in

homewares, general textile products).

BOARD’S ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT

overseeing risk management.

Regularly discusses with senior management the Company’s
competitive positioning, long term strategic plans, and key priorities.

While each committee is responsible for evaluating
certain risks and overseeing the management of such
risks, our entire Board is regularly informed about such
risks through committee reports and other presentations.

Ethics and Integrity

Our commitment to the highest ethical standards

begins with leadership. Our Ethics & Compliance

Program is overseen by our Legal Department,

which is led by our Chief Legal Officer. Our Ethics

& Compliance Program is supported by a team of

experienced compliance officers and

professionals, led by our Senior Vice President,

Head of Global Ethics & Compliance, who reports

supplemental training or guidance on the Code of Ethics, either in whole or in reference to

certain key topics, such as antitrust and competition laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption,

ETHICS & COMPLIANCE PROGRAM

or sanctions and export controls.

Continuous improvement to empower success with integrity

We also conduct targeted, function-specific training to empower individuals to recognize and

mitigate risks specific to their roles and responsibilities. WBD provides online and live

trainings to business partners to clearly communicate our values and expectations of ethics

and integrity, in accordance with our Business Partner Statement of Ethics. In addition, we

provide periodic and tailored messaging throughout the year to drive awareness of specific

policies, such as our gifts and entertainment policy around the holidays.

WBD conducts periodic Compliance Risk Assessments, including, but not limited to, anti-

bribery and anti-corruption, antitrust, trade controls/sanctions, culture and tone, and/or

conflicts of interest. The Ethics & Compliance Office conducts or coordinates with other

stakeholders (e.g., Internal Audit) to conduct these assessments. The results drive

enhancements to the Ethics & Compliance Program and related internal and financial

controls. Compliance risk assessments may be performed in response to:

•  trends identified in reports submitted to our Ethics & Compliance Hotline;

•  material changes to business operations; or

•  regulatory changes.

A key part of our Ethics & Compliance Program is our third-party risk management

procedures, which establish the expectation of ethical business practices by our business

partners and ensure that their values and business practices are aligned with WBD’s. These

risk-based procedures include screening and due diligence, contractual representations

and warranties, training, acknowledgement of our Business Partner Statement of Ethics,

and other detailed internal processes and approvals, which are required before the

Company can undertake certain business activities. With respect to transactions involving

consumer products, for example, WBD conducts sanctions and corruption screening and

due diligence on its business partners, and the Company may require business partners to

complete targeted fair-work and safe-environment questionnaires and submit social

compliance audits concerning labor, health, safety, and environmental practices.

 Anti-Bribery and
Anti-Corruption

The Company’s Ethics & Compliance Office has

responsibility for overseeing anti-bribery and anti-

corruption compliance, under the advisement of our Chief

Legal Officer. The Company is committed to complying

with all applicable anti-corruption laws. We strictly prohibit

giving, offering, authorizing, or taking bribes in any

circumstance, as addressed in our global Anti-Bribery

Anti-Corruption (ABAC) Policy, which prohibits facilitation

payments, and our Gifts and Entertainment Policy.

Our Code of Ethics and ABAC policy also contain

guidelines that address record keeping, approval

procedures, and appropriate behavior related to anti-

bribery and anti-corruption. WBD provides periodic

supplemental, risk-based trainings on anti-bribery and

anti-corruption. Our Third-Party Due Diligence &

Oversight Guidelines outline our procedures to identify,

onboard, and oversee third-party relationships consistent

with our values and our Company policies.

 Ethics Hotline

We foster an open environment in which employees and

external stakeholders feel empowered to speak up and

raise concerns. The Code of Ethics includes information

about how employees can report ethics concerns.

Employees can approach a member of management, a

People and Culture partner, or the Ethics & Compliance

Office. WBD is committed to fostering a culture where

employees feel secure in reporting known or suspected

misconduct in good faith. Importantly, the Company

unequivocally prohibits retaliation against any employee,

regardless of their level or position, who responsibly

discloses such concerns.

Additionally, any employee or external stakeholder

(including suppliers, customers, and other third parties)

can use our Ethics Hotline, which is operated by an

independent third-party provider and is publicly available

worldwide by phone and website. The hotline is proactively

shared with all employees, including via publication in our

Code of Ethics and on our Company intranet, and is also

prominently featured on the Ethics page of our public-

facing website so third parties are aware. Our Ethics

Hotline facilitates anonymous reporting, where permitted

by law, and all reports are treated confidentially.

WBD reviews every Ethics Hotline report and, where

appropriate, takes necessary investigative and corrective

actions. Upon receipt of a report, the Ethics & Compliance

Office assesses the report and determines the appropriate

stakeholder (e.g., Ethics & Compliance, Legal, and/or People

and Culture) to manage and, if necessary, investigate and

remediate, the alleged issue(s). Key metrics and information

related to Ethics Hotline reports, other compliance matters,

and labor, employment, and benefits matters are maintained

by the Ethics & Compliance Office in consultation with other

relevant stakeholders. Lessons learned from allegations and

investigations are often integrated into future trainings,

communications, and programmatic enhancements.

The Chief Legal Officer reports on Ethics Hotline and other

ethics and compliance matters quarterly to the Audit

Committee of the Board of Directors. WBD executive

management and other relevant stakeholders also receive

periodic reports during the year.

 Supplier Diversity

WBD is committed to establishing and growing

relationships with businesses owned and operated by

underrepresented groups to fuel innovation,

strengthening our corporate brand through inclusion

of culturally diverse ideas, adding value to our

operations, and creating positive economic impact in

the communities and audiences we serve.

WBD’s Supplier Diversity Program promotes,

increases, and improves the participation of

diverse businesses within our organizational supply

chain and investment portfolio.

We identify a diverse supplier as an organization with

at least 51% of ownership from designated diverse

backgrounds, including ethnic minorities, women,

LGBTQ+ individuals, veterans, and persons with

disabilities, and work with various partners and

organizations around the globe to facilitate an

introduction to new, diverse suppliers. We also

encourage diverse suppliers to connect with us

directly through our Procurement & Strategic

Sourcing and Supplier Diversity sites.

Data Privacy and
Cybersecurity

WBD views data protection as a foundational component

of its trusted relationships with customers, business

partners, employees, and talent around the world. To

maintain that trust, the Company is focused not only on

building and maintaining comprehensive security and

privacy programs for legal compliance and risk

management, but also on building and maintaining a

company culture in which responsible stewardship of data

is understood by every member of the WBD team to be a

core value of the organization and a central tenet of how

we do business every day.

WBD has dedicated teams of experts who are focused

teams, including the Global Information & Security team

(led by our Global Chief Information & Content Security

data protection liaisons for their business teams.

The Privacy Legal, Privacy Services, and Product

Compliance teams participate in monthly Privacy

Operations Steering Committee meetings (led by the EVP,

Legal, Streaming, Technology, Privacy, and Business

required. WBD is also committed to deleting data when it is no longer needed, as required

by law. We provide multiple avenues for data subjects to contact us in the event they have

concerns about their data privacy. We engage in privacy by design and review, and we

analyze proposed products and data use cases for privacy issues and, if necessary,

perform data protection impact assessments. We also include specific provisions in

contracts with vendors and other service providers requiring them to comply with our

Company’s privacy and data protection policies.

CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM

WBD’s cybersecurity program involves a combination of well-defined processes, skilled

personnel, advanced technologies, and a proactive mindset. It is based on best practices

and industry-standard frameworks including ISO 27001 and National Institute of Standards

and Technology (NIST) and comprises Information Security Governance, Risk, Data

Security, Compliance, Application Security/Development Security Operations, Product

Security, Cybersecurity Operations, IT Security Architecture and Engineering, Content

Security, eDiscovery, and Forensics.

To ensure that employees are utilizing the skills they are trained on, we send out

monthly phishing simulations that progress in their difficulty. Any employee that does

not react appropriately to the phishing email automatically gets directed to a training

page on the topic.

WBD has robust access control and encryption/de-identification techniques in place to

protect user data. We conduct targeted attack and penetration testing throughout every

year. In addition, we conduct an external attack and penetration testing across our network

on an annual basis. WBD has intrusion-detection systems in place, with global monitoring

across WBD’s end points, and has a 24/7 automated alerting system in place, with five levels

of alerts for potential cybersecurity breaches. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, the

Company’s Cybersecurity Incident Response (CSIR) plan, which uses a comprehensive and

proactive process to manage and mitigate the impact of security incidents on the

organization while continuously improving the organization’s overall security posture,

provides a transparent, standardized, and organized approach for handling cybersecurity-

related incidents. The plan consists of seven phases, which is shown on the right.

A BLACK LADY SKETCH SHOW

As a global media and entertainment company that tells the world’s stories through television, film, and online, WBD is

committed to building trusted relationships with our customers around the world.

JOURNALISTIC INTEGRITY AND MEDIA ETHICS

This trust is even more pivotal when it comes to the news

we report through CNN and TVN24 — Poland’s leading

independent news broadcaster and a part of TVN Network.

Our commitment to the independence of our editorial

decisions from all internal or outside influences, including

any political or commercial interests, is the bedrock of

building this trust and our ability to provide accurate and

useful information.

Whether on television or online, our journalists are required

to abide by high standards of ethics and adhere to

stringent standards of journalistic integrity. To set those

standards, the Company has implemented a

comprehensive set of policies and procedures that ensure

pluralism in news media content and that uphold our

editorial guidelines, which include being committed to

accuracy, independence, and respect to fairness for all

parties. They were recently updated to include guidelines

restricting the use of artificial intelligence (AI) platforms

without management approval. All relevant CNN employees

must read and attest to their adherence to the Standard &

Practices Policy Guide and relevant policies upon hire and

annually thereafter. TVN24 employees must adhere to

Guidelines for TVN News Journalists. They receive training

on the documents, which include, among others, guidelines

for news gathering and protecting individuals’ privacy.

Additional ad hoc trainings are also provided throughout

legal-orientated training sessions focused on how to

navigate the challenges of reporting on both election

campaigns and hate speech.

Both CNN and TVN24 have dedicated Standards and

Practices (S&P) teams responsible for monitoring and

ensuring that journalists adhere to the guidelines. At

TVN24, this team attends all editorial meetings and has

the authority to intervene if they observe deviations

from the guidelines that might compromise the

Company’s standards. This team also holds monthly

meetings to discuss crucial issues related to S&P policies

with journalists directly. However, they discuss and

monitor the S&P-orientated challenges daily. At CNN, the

S&P team reports to the Executive Vice President of

Integrity and Inclusion, who is responsible for ensuring

CNN’s brand integrity for television, digital, and sales is

upheld and advises on everything from conflicts of

interest and editorial fairness to reporting about

sensitive or controversial topics and the language and

images used.

Both CNN and TVN24 have launched fact-checking

platforms in an effort to combat misinformation and

disinformation. These platforms provide the audience with

verified, in-depth articles related to potential false claims

being made during a program or other public statements.

AI USE GUIDELINES

To support CNN editorial guidance

restricting the use of artificial intelligence

(AI) platforms without management

approval, teams are tasked with vetting

images from third parties, particularly in

conflict zones, to ensure they have the

necessary digital indicators of authenticity.

CNN is also exploring potential

opportunities to create AI detection and

protection technology.

WBD firmly believes in artistic freedom of expression and

actively supports the creative vision of producers, writers,

directors, actors, and others involved in making feature films.

Consistent with this belief, WBD’s film studios, Warner Bros.

Pictures, New Line Cinema, and DC Studios (together, the

“Studios”), work closely with creative talent to produce and

distribute for theatrical release feature films that appeal to

a wide array of audiences. At the same time, the Studios

strive to produce and distribute feature films in a

concerns, industry practices, and public health regulations,

as well as research in this area as they evolve over time.

of IP infringement and use external vendors to detect and remove

infringing intellectual property.

We also engage with intermediaries that facilitate anti-piracy best

practices, leverage our membership in a range of industry groups,

work with law enforcement and governmental entities like U.S.

Customs & Border Protection and foreign counterparts, and initiate

enforcement actions, including litigation, to address piracy and other

forms of IP infringement.

 Product Accessibility

We believe that everyone should be able to enjoy the entertainment

we provide so we strive to ensure that our content, websites, events,

sites, and applications are accessible to all, regardless of their

ability. We are always working to facilitate and improve this

accessibility, as well as the usability of our sites and applications.

Currently, we offer a range of tools and accessibility features,

including audio descriptions, closed captioning, keyboard

navigation, interoperability with popular screen readers, and other

accessibility features. As this is an ongoing effort, we are always

open to feedback from our users and viewers and are committed

to working with the industry, community, and policymakers to

deliver more inclusive and accessible entertainment to the world.

In 2023, Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden (WBSL) joined The

Television Access Project (TAP), a TV industry working group that is

focused on improving accessibility. Through working with TAP,

WBSL is adopting the “5 A Structure,” which is guidelines for

disability inclusion for U.K. production. To aid accessibility on

WBSL’s studio site, fully electric doors were installed in 2023 in the

multifunction area and will be installed in future developments.

BARBIE

BARBIE WITH ASL

Grounded in research and feedback from the Deaf community, as well as counsel

from community leaders, Warner Bros. and Max launched Barbie with ASL, the hit

blockbuster film interpreted in American Sign Language (ASL), featuring ASL

performer Leila Hanaumi.

To celebrate Barbie with ASL coming to the platform, Max hosted a special community

screening in collaboration with the esteemed Tony® Award–winning nonprofit, Deaf

West Theatre, a celebrated Deaf institution in Los Angeles for more than 30 years, and

RespectAbility, the mission of which is to fight stigmas and advance opportunities so

people with disabilities can fully participate in all aspects of community.

At the screening, Barbie star and Oscar®-nominee Margot Robbie joined

Leila Hanaumi on stage for a post-screening conversation for hundreds of community

members and Barbie fans.

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Index

Warner Bros. Discovery’s (WBD) approach to disclosing climate-related risks and opportunities is aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.

CLIMATE CHANGE GOVERNANCE

b) Management Role

a) Board Oversight

Our Board of Directors provides oversight of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)

activities, including climate-related issues, through the Nominating and Corporate

Governance Committee and Audit Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance

Committee is responsible for overseeing and monitoring the Company’s strategy, policies,

commitments, and initiatives with respect to ESG matters. The Audit Committee reviews

the Company’s key public ESG disclosures, including any climate-related disclosures, and

the adequacy and effectiveness of applicable internal reporting and controls related to

such disclosures. The Audit Committee also oversees key finance-related initiatives related

to ESG generally and climate specifically.

Our Chief Executive Officer provides executive direction on ESG strategy, including the

Company’s management of climate-related issues. In addition, WBD’s EVP, Global Head of

ESG, who reports directly to WBD’s Chief Legal Officer, has functional responsibility for ESG

and is charged with evaluating and implementing the strategic direction of WBD’s ESG and

climate-related initiatives. The EVP, Global Head of ESG, is supported by other senior

executives, including our Chief People and Culture Officer and Chief Global Diversity, Equity,

& Inclusion Officer.

STRATEGY

WBD has identified climate-related risks that may have adverse effects on our Company.

The nature of these risks depends on regulatory and market requirements, pressure to

financing may also consider our performance in these areas and the ratings of

external firms (which we have limited ability to influence) in their decisions involving our

Company, which could impact our cost of capital and adversely affect our businesss.

RISK MANAGEMENT

WBD recognizes climate change as a critical global issue, and we endeavor to do our part

to drive positive change. As a media company, our impact on this issue is limited. Therefore,

we focus our efforts where we have the most significant opportunities for progress,

balanced with investments in a range of critical ESG issues. We are committed to lowering

our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, investing in clean energy, and telling stories that will

inspire our audiences.

As a newly formed organization, we are focused on continuing legacy efforts to

actively reduce operational emissions, identifying and implementing new initiatives

(see Sustainable Workplaces and Sustainable Productions), while simultaneously

building a longer-term, enterprise-level strategy for our future as a new organization.

METRICS AND TARGETS

Throughout 2023, WBD established the greenhouse gas emissions inventory for Scope 1

and 2 and five material Scope 3 categories. Additionally, we worked to understand and plan

for forthcoming climate-related disclosure regulations.

Refer to the Climate Action section of the Sustainability Report for information on our

metrics and emissions.

In 2024, we will continue our efforts to reduce emissions, i.e., increasing energy efficiency,

exploring investments in renewable energy projects, and potentially purchasing Renewable

Energy Credits (RECs) and carbon offsets, where appropriate. We will also evaluate the

opportunity to set enterprise-level GHG emissions reduction goals, supported by a

roadmap to ensure we can deliver on our commitments.

Scope 1 and 2 Calculation Methodology

WBD selected operational control as the approach for consolidating its organizational boundary. WBD includes emissions from operations across its global operating units (which includes

subsidiaries that are 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by WBD). The facilities falling under WBD’s operational control comprise primarily of offices, warehouses and production studios

across North America (NA); Latin America (LATAM); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific (APAC). Emissions were calculated for January 1 - December 31, 2023; for

facilities that closed prior to the year’s end, estimations only occurred for the period the facility was under WBD’s operational control.

WBD’s Scope 1 inventory consists of emissions from the combustion of stationary and transport fuels such as natural gas, diesel, and petroleum at owned and leased facilities and in owned

or leased vehicles, equipment, and private jets under operational control. Scope 2 includes emissions from the purchase of electricity, steam, heating, and cooling used on-site at the

owned and leased facilities across WBD’s global facility portfolio that are under its operational control. Note that all Scope 1 and 2 emissions used Global Warming Potentials (GWP) from the

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).

 Scope 3 Calculation Methodology

WBD’s Scope 3 inventory includes indirect GHG emissions (not included in Scope 2) that occur in WBD’s value chain. These emissions are inclusive of the upstream and downstream

emissions categories deemed material through an emissions screening process conducted in 2023, which are listed below:

Category 1: Purchased goods and services | Category 2: Capital goods | Category 3: Fuel- and Energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2) | Category 6: Business travel |

Category 7: Employee commuting

Note that all Scope 3 emissions used Global Warming Potentials (GWP) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (aside from DEFRA fuel emission factors used in category 3, FERA which
used AR5 GWPs). No Scope 3 emissions were calculated using data from suppliers or other value chain partners.

Spend-based methodology:
Emissions from purchased goods
and services and capital goods
were calculated using direct spend.
The purchased goods and services
and capital goods were mapped to
a North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS) code
of the EPA supply chain emission
factors (with margins) and
adjusted for inflation from the base
year (2021) to align with 2023
spend. Only purchased goods and
services and capital goods in
alignment with the minimum
boundaries for Categories 1 and 2
were included.

Average-data methodology:
Emissions were calculated using
the total fuel, electricity, steam,
heating and cooling consumed by
WBD included in the Scope 1 and 2
calculations. The consumed
electricity, steam, heating, cooling,
and fuel was multiplied by the
relevant well-to-tank (WTT) and
transmission and distribution (T&D)
emission factors.

A weighted average
emissions factor based on
WBD’s associated NAICS
codes was used to
calculate emissions for

Calculation Methodology

Category 6

Business travel  Distance-based methodology: Emissions

from business travel were calculated using
total distance traveled by air, road-vehicle,
and rail when travel distance was provided.
Total distance for each trip was multiplied
by cradle-to-gate emission factors to
determine the emissions for each trip.

Spend-based methodology: When only
spend was provided, emissions from
business travel were calculated using the
reimbursed spend for the vehicle used for
business travel and total spend from non
preferred chartered flights. Total spend
was multiplied by the relevant NAICS code
and adjusted for inflation from the base
year (2021) to align with 2023 spend.

Note: Emissions from hotel stays, which fall
outside of the GHGP minimum boundary,
were included within the category 6 total.

Average-data and distance methodology:
Emissions from employee commuting were
calculated by estimating the average
distance traveled for each WBD employee
(regular, intern, project, and temporary) for
each location, based on nationally provided
commuting data by mode and distance.
Total distance was then multiplied by days
in office to determine average distance
commuted per year. Total distance was
multiplied by EPA upstream and
downstream T&D for each transportation
type.

Note: Emissions from telecommuting, which
fall outside of the GHGP minimum
boundary, were included within the
category 7 total.

2023 Sustainability Report Talent Recruitment

TALENT PIPELINE STRATEGY

Our multifaceted talent pipeline is built by our

central Talent Acquisition Sourcing team,

particularly within areas experiencing growth and/

or attrition. This allows us to create a hiring forecast

to fulfill upcoming talent needs and develop diverse

and functional pools of talent with the skill sets

needed across our technology, creative, and

corporate businesses.

Championing inclusion is central to our talent-

acquisition philosophy. It is woven into our end-to-

end talent attraction strategy and recruiting

processes, from our candidate sourcing strategies

and recruiting processes to the partnerships,

platforms, and tools we invest in.

To further drive meaningful impact, we have

dedicated diversity sources and a Diversity Outreach

2023 Sustainability Report Engagement and Retention

Employee engagement and retention is crucial to WBD. We aim to

promote an open feedback culture and foster a thriving and

continuously evolving workforce by establishing touchpoints through

surveys spanning the entire employee lifecycle. This includes:

•

Annual employee engagement survey

• Candidate experience survey

• Onboarding survey

• Exit survey

• Targeted ad-hoc surveys addressing specific initiatives

important factor guiding decision-making related to employee retention

and other people-related strategies. Analyzing employee departures

and combining that with the exit survey insights enables us to

continually refine and enhance our approaches to talent retention.

 Labor Relations

We recognize that we need all our creative partners to feel valued and

rewarded, and that we must be flexible and adaptable to focus on telling

great stories. As one of the world’s leading producers of film and

television content, WBD entities such as Warner Bros. Television, Warner

Our efforts to make diverse stories created by diverse voices are fueled by our increased

investment in pipeline programs. In 2023, we focused on expanding the scope of global and

regional programs for underrepresented creatives, which includes greater emphasis on

training and placement in the WBD ecosystem.

Our initiatives include:

Talent Acquisition Diversity Outreach: Our Talent Acquisition Diversity Outreach team was
established with the primary responsibility of recruiting diverse talent and building diverse

talent pools. We utilize strategic partnerships across core functional areas, as well as

in-house initiatives designed to attract underrepresented talent communities.

Investments in Tools and Technologies: We invest in a number of diversity-focused
technologies, providing access to diverse talent databases and allowing us to further

optimize our diverse talent pools.

Implement Selection and Assessment Processes: Our selection and assessment
process is designed to eliminate bias throughout the recruitment process in a number

of ways:

•

Required Interview and Feedback Training: For all interviewers, covering the end-to-end

WBD recruiting process and inclusive hiring philosophy: “The Hiring Playbook Simplified.”

• Standardized Recruiting Loops: Assessing candidates across a range of competencies

aligned with the functional requirements of the role, as well as alignment with our Guiding

Principles (core values).

• “Blind” Debriefs: Unbiased feedback sessions in which assessors are required to submit

written candidate feedback and a recommendation for hire or no hire ahead of a formal

debrief to avoid unintended influence from other interviewers.

• Offers are extended based on aggregate feedback and recommendations.

 TALENT ACQUISITION DIVERSITY OUTREACH

One of the ways we build diversity in our entry-level candidate pipeline is through our corporate internship program. We

form targeted partnerships with transformative industry partners in the U.S. and the U.K., including those partnering with

Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), as well as organizations

supporting young people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and people with disabilities.

Through this initiative, WBD teams have built

meaningful partnerships with schools, festivals,

and nonprofit organizations to deepen the

Company’s reach into underrepresented

communities, extend program offerings, and

further support partners’ programming.

In March 2023, WBD Access rebranded and

expanded the Access Directors Program to

cultivate underrepresented and emerging talent,

now led by WBD’s DEI team. To equip participants

with skills and experience needed to succeed in the

industry, the program provides opportunities to

INVESTMENTS IN TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES

WBD collects data related to DEI trends, which is analyzed

by leadership team members on a quarterly basis. This

proactive approach allows the Company to assess DEI

trends at every step of the recruitment process, as well as

in the engagement and retention strategy.

DEI LEARNING — INCLUSION JOURNEY FOR

EXECUTIVES

In 2023, we introduced an impactful 12-month journey for

our top leaders, consisting of 40 hours of immersive

leadership training. The program consists of four modules:

Finding My Why for DEI, Inclusive Leadership in Action,

Leveraging DEI to Create Business Value, and

Operationalizing DEI in Everything We Do. Through this

initiative, which also includes Leading Inclusively Toolkits

and a Leading Inclusively Playbook to institute best

practices, we are not only shaping our leadership but also

paving the way for a more inclusive industry.

40 hours

of immersive leadership training is provided through

our Inclusion Journey for Executives, empowering

leaders to excel in their professional journeys and

drive impactful change.

Business Resource Groups (BRGs) are an important part of WBD’s inclusion strategies focused on career, culture, community, and creating connections across the business. These

voluntary, employee-led groups unite colleagues on the basis of common characteristics, life experiences, purpose, and interests, and they foster a diverse workplace and inclusive culture.

Representing veterans, ethnic minorities, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and more, the BRGs build community, drive authentic inclusion, provide professional development

opportunities, and engage employees globally.

As of December 2023, 16 BRGs across the globe include approximately 6,300 members and provide support in our local regions where we have offices globally.

Neurodiversity: TVN produced the Polish version of The A Talks, the groundbreaking

French format featuring 50 individuals living on the autism spectrum trying their hand

at journalism and interviewing well-known personalities. The Polish title Autentyczni

(The Authentic) was aired in primetime in November and was very well-received by the

audience. The program’s launch was also accompanied by a social autism spectrum

disorder–awareness campaign.

LGBTQ+: TVN24 is the only leading news channel in Poland that regularly addresses

the challenges faced by the LGBTQ+ community. This includes the multi-awarded

documentary All About My Child, a story about transgender children from the

perspective of their parents.

we focus our efforts where we have the most significant opportunities for progress,

balanced with investments in a range of critical ESG issues. We are committed to lowering

our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, investing in clean energy, and telling stories that will

inspire our audiences.

As WBD, we are focused on continuing legacy efforts to actively reduce operational

emissions, identifying and implementing new initiatives (see Sustainable Workplaces and

Sustainable Productions), while simultaneously building a longer-term, enterprise-level

strategy for our future as a new organization.

stakeholders to gather insights, identifying disclosure opportunities, and recommending

next steps. We established the greenhouse gas emissions inventory for Scope 1 and 2 and

five material Scope 3 categories. Additionally, we worked to understand and plan for

forthcoming climate-related disclosure regulations.

In 2024, we will continue our efforts to reduce emissions, for example, increasing energy

efficiency and exploring renewable energy projects and the potential purchase of

Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and carbon offsets, where appropriate. We will also

evaluate the opportunity to set enterprise-level GHG emissions reduction goals, supported

by a roadmap to ensure we can deliver on our commitments.

We believe these efforts are important to the ongoing success of our business as a

premier global media and entertainment company.

 Sustainable Workplaces

WBD models our workplaces for optimal efficiency, health, and sustainability. We encourage employees to innovate and participate in

environmentally friendly practices that promote more sustainable workplaces and more efficient business practices.

EFFICIENT FACILITIES AND GREEN BUILDINGS

WBD seeks opportunities to improve the resource-use efficiency of

our facilities, including our corporate offices and studios. For

example, we have a history of being dedicated to green building

certifications. We maintain an ongoing membership with the U.S.

Green Building Council, which provides us with new insights into

green building practices. We currently operate 13 Building Research

Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM)–

certified buildings located in the U.K. We also operate 8 Leadership

in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)–certified buildings and 1

locations identified in the U.K. where renewable energy was part of

the energy procurement process. This helped to offset 100% of

electricity consumption at these locations, equivalent to nearly

30,000 MWh. In 2023, WBD generated and purchased 44,841 MWh of

renewable energy in Finland, New Zealand, Poland, the United States,

and the United Kingdom with 1,035 MWh generated on-site.6, 7, 8

Across our studios and offices, our Global Real Estate and Facilities

schedule for many employees. Global space consolidations

will reduce the Company’s carbon footprint.

Flexible working also leads to a substantial reduction in

employee commuting, which positively impacts the global

carbon footprint.

WASTE REDUCTION

WBD is committed to identifying ways to further reduce

waste in our business operations. Our initiatives to

reduce and divert waste around the globe save

resources and reduce our GHG emissions. We focus on

source reduction; reusing materials, including donating

production materials and other lightly used materials;

recycling materials; and composting organics and

donating leftover food. We are working to reduce single-

use materials and divert waste through recycling and

composting across our studios and offices.

WATER MANAGEMENT

We are committed to identifying ways to reduce water

use in our business operations. For example, at our

Burbank studio, we utilize reclaimed water for our

landscaping irrigation and cooling towers and are

reducing consumption of reclaimed water by installing

a water softener for a cooling tower. Additionally, there

are stormwater infiltration systems in place that utilize

slow infiltration that allows water to slowly seep into

the ground.

230 PARK AVENUE SOUTH

DRIVING EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AT OUR GLOBAL HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK CITY

Our New York City global headquarters at 230 Park Ave. South achieved LEED Gold–certification and

WELL–certification. The project includes 70% ENERGY STAR–labeled equipment and appliances, at

least a 20% reduction of the lighting-power density from efficient light fixtures, 51% energy savings

from office equipment selections, and 35% water-use reduction from low-flow fixtures.

We also have measures in place to reduce landfill, food, plastic, and other waste at our headquarters.

Our waste reduction programs include a container service, education signage, audits, composting,

and removal of plastic bottles from vending machines and from the café.

throughout the project. To reduce reliance on generators,

approximately 85% of all power used during the U.K. shoot

came from house power and the vast majority of this was

used at Warner Bros. Studio Leavesden, which operates on

a 100% renewable energy tariff. Further, production used

many items that were handed down from other

productions and were donated to various sources once

they were at the end of their useful life within the industry.

For instance, rigging silks that could not be used by

Ethics and Integrity

Our commitment to the highest ethical standards

begins with leadership. Our Ethics & Compliance

supplemental training or guidance on the Code of Ethics, either in whole or in reference to

certain key topics, such as antitrust and competition laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption,

or sanctions and export controls.

Continuous improvement to empower success with integrity

We also conduct targeted, function-specific training to empower individuals to recognize and

mitigate risks specific to their roles and responsibilities. WBD provides online and live

trainings to business partners to clearly communicate our values and expectations of ethics

and integrity, in accordance with our Business Partner Statement of Ethics. In addition, we

provide periodic and tailored messaging throughout the year to drive awareness of specific

policies, such as our gifts and entertainment policy around the holidays.

WBD conducts periodic Compliance Risk Assessments, including, but not limited to, anti-

bribery and anti-corruption, antitrust, trade controls/sanctions, culture and tone, and/or

conflicts of interest. The Ethics & Compliance Office conducts or coordinates with other

stakeholders (e.g., Internal Audit) to conduct these assessments. The results drive

enhancements to the Ethics & Compliance Program and related internal and financial

controls. Compliance risk assessments may be performed in response to:

•  trends identified in reports submitted to our Ethics & Compliance Hotline;

•  material changes to business operations; or

•  regulatory changes.

A key part of our Ethics & Compliance Program is our third-party risk management

procedures, which establish the expectation of ethical business practices by our business

partners and ensure that their values and business practices are aligned with WBD’s. These

risk-based procedures include screening and due diligence, contractual representations

and warranties, training, acknowledgement of our Business Partner Statement of Ethics,

and other detailed internal processes and approvals, which are required before the

Company can undertake certain business activities. With respect to transactions involving

consumer products, for example, WBD conducts sanctions and corruption screening and

due diligence on its business partners, and the Company may require business partners to

complete targeted fair-work and safe-environment questionnaires and submit social

compliance audits concerning labor, health, safety, and environmental practices.

 Anti-Bribery and
Anti-Corruption

The Company’s Ethics & Compliance Office has

responsibility for overseeing anti-bribery and anti-

corruption compliance, under the advisement of our Chief

Legal Officer. The Company is committed to complying

with all applicable anti-corruption laws. We strictly prohibit

giving, offering, authorizing, or taking bribes in any

circumstance, as addressed in our global Anti-Bribery

Anti-Corruption (ABAC) Policy, which prohibits facilitation

payments, and our Gifts and Entertainment Policy.

Our Code of Ethics and ABAC policy also contain

guidelines that address record keeping, approval

procedures, and appropriate behavior related to anti-

bribery and anti-corruption. WBD provides periodic

supplemental, risk-based trainings on anti-bribery and

anti-corruption. Our Third-Party Due Diligence &

Oversight Guidelines outline our procedures to identify,

onboard, and oversee third-party relationships consistent

with our values and our Company policies.

 Ethics Hotline

We foster an open environment in which employees and

external stakeholders feel empowered to speak up and

raise concerns. The Code of Ethics includes information

about how employees can report ethics concerns.

Employees can approach a member of management, a

People and Culture partner, or the Ethics & Compliance

Office. WBD is committed to fostering a culture where

employees feel secure in reporting known or suspected

misconduct in good faith. Importantly, the Company

unequivocally prohibits retaliation against any employee,

regardless of their level or position, who responsibly

discloses such concerns.

Additionally, any employee or external stakeholder

(including suppliers, customers, and other third parties)

can use our Ethics Hotline, which is operated by an

independent third-party provider and is publicly available

worldwide by phone and website. The hotline is proactively

shared with all employees, including via publication in our

Code of Ethics and on our Company intranet, and is also

prominently featured on the Ethics page of our public-

facing website so third parties are aware. Our Ethics

Hotline facilitates anonymous reporting, where permitted

by law, and all reports are treated confidentially.

WBD reviews every Ethics Hotline report and, where

appropriate, takes necessary investigative and corrective

actions. Upon receipt of a report, the Ethics & Compliance

Office assesses the report and determines the appropriate

stakeholder (e.g., Ethics & Compliance, Legal, and/or People

and Culture) to manage and, if necessary, investigate and

remediate, the alleged issue(s). Key metrics and information

related to Ethics Hotline reports, other compliance matters,

and labor, employment, and benefits matters are maintained

by the Ethics & Compliance Office in consultation with other

relevant stakeholders. Lessons learned from allegations and

investigations are often integrated into future trainings,

communications, and programmatic enhancements.

The Chief Legal Officer reports on Ethics Hotline and other

ethics and compliance matters quarterly to the Audit

Committee of the Board of Directors. WBD executive

management and other relevant stakeholders also receive

periodic reports during the year.

 Supplier Diversity

WBD is committed to establishing and growing

relationships with businesses owned and operated by

underrepresented groups to fuel innovation,

strengthening our corporate brand through inclusion

of culturally diverse ideas, adding value to our

operations, and creating positive economic impact in

the communities and audiences we serve.

WBD’s Supplier Diversity Program promotes,

increases, and improves the participation of

diverse businesses within our organizational supply

chain and investment portfolio.

We identify a diverse supplier as an organization with

at least 51% of ownership from designated diverse

backgrounds, including ethnic minorities, women,

LGBTQ+ individuals, veterans, and persons with

disabilities, and work with various partners and

organizations around the globe to facilitate an

introduction to new, diverse suppliers. We also

encourage diverse suppliers to connect with us

directly through our Procurement & Strategic

Sourcing and Supplier Diversity sites.

Data Privacy and
Cybersecurity

WBD views data protection as a foundational component

of its trusted relationships with customers, business

partners, employees, and talent around the world. To

maintain that trust, the Company is focused not only on

building and maintaining comprehensive security and

privacy programs for legal compliance and risk

management, but also on building and maintaining a

company culture in which responsible stewardship of data

is understood by every member of the WBD team to be a

core value of the organization and a central tenet of how

we do business every day.

WBD has dedicated teams of experts who are focused

teams, including the Global Information & Security team

(led by our Global Chief Information & Content Security

Officer), and internal business stakeholders, who act as

data protection liaisons for their business teams.

The Privacy Legal, Privacy Services, and Product

Compliance teams participate in monthly Privacy

Operations Steering Committee meetings (led by the EVP,

Legal, Streaming, Technology, Privacy, and Business

Operations) and report up to a C-Level AI and Data

Steering Committee. In addition, the Board has ultimate

oversight of all enterprise risks, including data privacy and

cybersecurity. The Board has delegated responsibility for

cybersecurity and data privacy risks to the Audit

Committee, which receives quarterly reports on relevant

data privacy and cybersecurity issues and updates from

through lawful and transparent means, with explicit consent of the data subject, where

required. WBD is also committed to deleting data when it is no longer needed, as required

by law. We provide multiple avenues for data subjects to contact us in the event they have

concerns about their data privacy. We engage in privacy by design and review, and we

analyze proposed products and data use cases for privacy issues and, if necessary,

perform data protection impact assessments. We also include specific provisions in

contracts with vendors and other service providers requiring them to comply with our

Company’s privacy and data protection policies.

CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM

WBD’s cybersecurity program involves a combination of well-defined processes, skilled

personnel, advanced technologies, and a proactive mindset. It is based on best practices

and industry-standard frameworks including ISO 27001 and National Institute of Standards

and Technology (NIST) and comprises Information Security Governance, Risk, Data

Security, Compliance, Application Security/Development Security Operations, Product

Security, Cybersecurity Operations, IT Security Architecture and Engineering, Content

Security, eDiscovery, and Forensics.

To ensure that employees are utilizing the skills they are trained on, we send out

monthly phishing simulations that progress in their difficulty. Any employee that does

not react appropriately to the phishing email automatically gets directed to a training

page on the topic.

WBD has robust access control and encryption/de-identification techniques in place to

protect user data. We conduct targeted attack and penetration testing throughout every

year. In addition, we conduct an external attack and penetration testing across our network

on an annual basis. WBD has intrusion-detection systems in place, with global monitoring

across WBD’s end points, and has a 24/7 automated alerting system in place, with five levels

of alerts for potential cybersecurity breaches. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, the

Company’s Cybersecurity Incident Response (CSIR) plan, which uses a comprehensive and

proactive process to manage and mitigate the impact of security incidents on the

organization while continuously improving the organization’s overall security posture,

provides a transparent, standardized, and organized approach for handling cybersecurity-

related incidents. The plan consists of seven phases, which is shown on the right.

TRADE ASSOCIATIONS

WBD belongs to a number of U.S. trade associations for

various business-related reasons, such as networking with

peer firms and helping develop industry best practices.

While we pay membership dues, we do not control how such

dues are spent, and we may not agree with the position or

decision an organization takes on a given matter. Information

on the trade associations we are a member of can be found

on our website. In March of 2025, we will report the non–tax-

deductible portion of the dues for those named trade

associations that we paid in the preceding calendar year

that have been designated for lobbying expenditures by the

trade association.

LOBBYING ACTIVITY

The Company employs and occasionally contracts for

lobbying services to address issues of interest to the

Company. These activities are conducted in compliance with

all legal requirements. We report our lobbying activity related

to the federal government of the United States, as required

by law, to the Secretary of the Senate and to the Office of the

Clerk of the House of Representatives. These reports are

available on the websites of those entities. We also disclose

state-based lobbying activities to the relevant agencies.

independent news broadcaster and a part of TVN Network.

Our commitment to the independence of our editorial

decisions from all internal or outside influences, including

any political or commercial interests, is the bedrock of

building this trust and our ability to provide accurate and

useful information.

Whether on television or online, our journalists are required

to abide by high standards of ethics and adhere to

stringent standards of journalistic integrity. To set those

standards, the Company has implemented a

comprehensive set of policies and procedures that ensure

pluralism in news media content and that uphold our

editorial guidelines, which include being committed to

accuracy, independence, and respect to fairness for all

parties. They were recently updated to include guidelines

restricting the use of artificial intelligence (AI) platforms

without management approval. All relevant CNN employees

must read and attest to their adherence to the Standard &

Practices Policy Guide and relevant policies upon hire and

annually thereafter. TVN24 employees must adhere to

Guidelines for TVN News Journalists. They receive training

on the documents, which include, among others, guidelines

for news gathering and protecting individuals’ privacy.

Additional ad hoc trainings are also provided throughout

legal-orientated training sessions focused on how to

navigate the challenges of reporting on both election

campaigns and hate speech.

Both CNN and TVN24 have dedicated Standards and

Practices (S&P) teams responsible for monitoring and

ensuring that journalists adhere to the guidelines. At

TVN24, this team attends all editorial meetings and has

the authority to intervene if they observe deviations

from the guidelines that might compromise the

Company’s standards. This team also holds monthly

meetings to discuss crucial issues related to S&P policies

with journalists directly. However, they discuss and

monitor the S&P-orientated challenges daily. At CNN, the

S&P team reports to the Executive Vice President of

Integrity and Inclusion, who is responsible for ensuring

CNN’s brand integrity for television, digital, and sales is

upheld and advises on everything from conflicts of

interest and editorial fairness to reporting about

sensitive or controversial topics and the language and

images used.

Both CNN and TVN24 have launched fact-checking

platforms in an effort to combat misinformation and

disinformation. These platforms provide the audience with

verified, in-depth articles related to potential false claims

being made during a program or other public statements.

AI USE GUIDELINES

To support CNN editorial guidance

restricting the use of artificial intelligence

(AI) platforms without management

approval, teams are tasked with vetting

images from third parties, particularly in

conflict zones, to ensure they have the

necessary digital indicators of authenticity.

CNN is also exploring potential

opportunities to create AI detection and

protection technology.

WBD firmly believes in artistic freedom of expression and

actively supports the creative vision of producers, writers,

directors, actors, and others involved in making feature films.

Consistent with this belief, WBD’s film studios, Warner Bros.

Pictures, New Line Cinema, and DC Studios (together, the

“Studios”), work closely with creative talent to produce and

distribute for theatrical release feature films that appeal to

a wide array of audiences. At the same time, the Studios

strive to produce and distribute feature films in a

concerns, industry practices, and public health regulations,

as well as research in this area as they evolve over time.

of IP infringement and use external vendors to detect and remove

infringing intellectual property.

We also engage with intermediaries that facilitate anti-piracy best

practices, leverage our membership in a range of industry groups,

work with law enforcement and governmental entities like U.S.

Customs & Border Protection and foreign counterparts, and initiate

enforcement actions, including litigation, to address piracy and other

forms of IP infringement.

 Product Accessibility

We believe that everyone should be able to enjoy the entertainment

we provide so we strive to ensure that our content, websites, events,

sites, and applications are accessible to all, regardless of their

ability. We are always working to facilitate and improve this

accessibility, as well as the usability of our sites and applications.

Currently, we offer a range of tools and accessibility features,

including audio descriptions, closed captioning, keyboard

navigation, interoperability with popular screen readers, and other

accessibility features. As this is an ongoing effort, we are always

open to feedback from our users and viewers and are committed

to working with the industry, community, and policymakers to

deliver more inclusive and accessible entertainment to the world.

In 2023, Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden (WBSL) joined The

Television Access Project (TAP), a TV industry working group that is

focused on improving accessibility. Through working with TAP,

WBSL is adopting the “5 A Structure,” which is guidelines for

disability inclusion for U.K. production. To aid accessibility on

WBSL’s studio site, fully electric doors were installed in 2023 in the

BARBIE

BARBIE WITH ASL

Grounded in research and feedback from the Deaf community, as well as counsel

from community leaders, Warner Bros. and Max launched Barbie with ASL, the hit

blockbuster film interpreted in American Sign Language (ASL), featuring ASL

performer Leila Hanaumi.

To celebrate Barbie with ASL coming to the platform, Max hosted a special community

screening in collaboration with the esteemed Tony® Award–winning nonprofit, Deaf

West Theatre, a celebrated Deaf institution in Los Angeles for more than 30 years, and

RespectAbility, the mission of which is to fight stigmas and advance opportunities so

people with disabilities can fully participate in all aspects of community.

At the screening, Barbie star and Oscar®-nominee Margot Robbie joined

Leila Hanaumi on stage for a post-screening conversation for hundreds of community

members and Barbie fans.

the Company’s key public ESG disclosures, including any climate-related disclosures, and

the adequacy and effectiveness of applicable internal reporting and controls related to

such disclosures. The Audit Committee also oversees key finance-related initiatives related

to ESG generally and climate specifically.

Our Chief Executive Officer provides executive direction on ESG strategy, including the

Company’s management of climate-related issues. In addition, WBD’s EVP, Global Head of

ESG, who reports directly to WBD’s Chief Legal Officer, has functional responsibility for ESG

and is charged with evaluating and implementing the strategic direction of WBD’s ESG and

climate-related initiatives. The EVP, Global Head of ESG, is supported by other senior

executives, including our Chief People and Culture Officer and Chief Global Diversity, Equity,

& Inclusion Officer.

financing may also consider our performance in these areas and the ratings of

external firms (which we have limited ability to influence) in their decisions involving our

Company, which could impact our cost of capital and adversely affect our businesss.

RISK MANAGEMENT

WBD recognizes climate change as a critical global issue, and we endeavor to do our part

to drive positive change. As a media company, our impact on this issue is limited. Therefore,

we focus our efforts where we have the most significant opportunities for progress,

balanced with investments in a range of critical ESG issues. We are committed to lowering

our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, investing in clean energy, and telling stories that will

inspire our audiences.

As a newly formed organization, we are focused on continuing legacy efforts to

actively reduce operational emissions, identifying and implementing new initiatives

(see Sustainable Workplaces and Sustainable Productions), while simultaneously

building a longer-term, enterprise-level strategy for our future as a new organization.

METRICS AND TARGETS

Throughout 2023, WBD established the greenhouse gas emissions inventory for Scope 1

and 2 and five material Scope 3 categories. Additionally, we worked to understand and plan

for forthcoming climate-related disclosure regulations.

Refer to the Climate Action section of the Sustainability Report for information on our

metrics and emissions.

In 2024, we will continue our efforts to reduce emissions, i.e., increasing energy efficiency,

exploring investments in renewable energy projects, and potentially purchasing Renewable

Energy Credits (RECs) and carbon offsets, where appropriate. We will also evaluate the

opportunity to set enterprise-level GHG emissions reduction goals, supported by a

roadmap to ensure we can deliver on our commitments.

Scope 1 and 2 Calculation Methodology

WBD selected operational control as the approach for consolidating its organizational boundary. WBD includes emissions from operations across its global operating units (which includes

subsidiaries that are 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by WBD). The facilities falling under WBD’s operational control comprise primarily of offices, warehouses and production studios

across North America (NA); Latin America (LATAM); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific (APAC). Emissions were calculated for January 1 - December 31, 2023; for

facilities that closed prior to the year’s end, estimations only occurred for the period the facility was under WBD’s operational control.

WBD’s Scope 1 inventory consists of emissions from the combustion of stationary and transport fuels such as natural gas, diesel, and petroleum at owned and leased facilities and in owned

or leased vehicles, equipment, and private jets under operational control. Scope 2 includes emissions from the purchase of electricity, steam, heating, and cooling used on-site at the

owned and leased facilities across WBD’s global facility portfolio that are under its operational control. Note that all Scope 1 and 2 emissions used Global Warming Potentials (GWP) from the

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).

Average-data and distance methodology:
Emissions from employee commuting were
calculated by estimating the average
distance traveled for each WBD employee
(regular, intern, project, and temporary) for
each location, based on nationally provided
commuting data by mode and distance.
Total distance was then multiplied by days
in office to determine average distance
commuted per year. Total distance was
