  "summary": "Headline:\nNetflix\u2019s Q4 2025 content accounting overview highlights continued disciplined application of ASC 920 and ASC 926 standards, reflecting stable content capitalization and amortization practices aligned with historical viewing patterns.\n\nGrowth & revenue drivers:\n- Content costs are split between licensed content (ASC 920) and self-produced originals (ASC 926).\n- Self-produced content ownership (e.g., Stranger Things, Squid Game) provides cost advantages, IP ownership, and monetization flexibility.\n- Licensed content includes both Netflix originals licensed from studios (e.g., Wednesday, Emily in Paris) and 2nd run titles (e.g., Shameless, The Blacklist).\n- Over 90% of content costs are amortized within four years, reflecting accelerated consumption and revenue recognition.\n\nMargins / profitability:\n- Content amortization is recorded in cost of revenues, amortized over the shorter of availability window, useful life, or 10 years.\n- First-run topical programming (sports, live events) is expensed immediately, impacting short-term margins.\n- Capitalized content assets and related liabilities are reflected on the balance sheet, supporting transparency in content investment.\n\nGuidance & outlook:\n- No explicit financial guidance or outlook provided in this content accounting overview.\n- The company continues to review amortization schedules quarterly to align with viewing trends and optimize expense recognition.\n\nRisks / watchpoints:\n- Changes in viewing patterns could affect amortization schedules and content asset valuations.\n- Reliance on self-produced content requires ongoing investment and successful IP monetization.\n- No material impact from ASU 2019-2 adoption, but future accounting standard changes could affect content capitalization.\n- Monitoring content liabilities and cash flow impact remains important given large content investments.\n\nSummary:\nNetflix maintains a consistent and transparent content accounting framework, balancing licensed and owned content investments with accelerated amortization to match consumption. While no direct financial metrics or guidance were disclosed, the approach supports stable margin management and asset capitalization aligned with evolving viewer behavior.",
