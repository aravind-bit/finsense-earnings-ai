Prepared Remarks – CFO

Revenue increased 8% year-over-year driven by data center and client processor demand.
Gross margins expanded 120 basis points due to a favorable product mix.
Operating expenses decreased 4% as we continued to streamline headcount and marketing.
We are raising full-year revenue guidance to mid-teens growth and expect further margin expansion in the second half.
